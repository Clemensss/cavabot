Like an angel that has no\Nsense of mercy...
Rise, young boy, to the heavens\Nlike a legend.
Cold winds, as blue as the sea,
Tear open the door to\Nyour heart, I see.
But unknowing you seem, just\Nstaring at me...
Standing there smiling serenely.
Desperate, for something to touch...
A moment of kindness like\Nthat in a dream.
Your innocent eyes, have yet no idea...
Of the path your destiny will follow.
But someday you’ll become aware of...
Everything that you’ve got behind you.
Your wings are for seeking out a new...
Future that only you can search for.
The cruel angel’s thesis enters through\Nthe window of your soul.
If you should betray the chapel\Nof your memories.
The cruel angel’s thesis bleeds through\Na portal like your pulsing blood.
So, boy, stand tall and embrace\Nthe fire of the legend,
Embracing the universe like\Na blazing star!
As of 12:30 PM today, a special state\Nof emergency has been declared...
...for the Kanto and Chubu regions\Nsurrounding the Tokai district.
All residents must evacuate to their\Ndesignated shelters immediately.
Repeat: As of 12:30 PM today...
...the Kanto and Chubu regions\Nsurrounding the Tokai district...
...have been declared to be under\Na state of emergency.
All residents must evacuate to their\Ndesignated shelters immediately.
Christ, why at a time like this?
Due to the special emergency...
...all lines are currently unavailable.
It’s no use...
I shouldn’t have come here after all.
Well, I guess we won’t be meeting here.
I’ll have to go to a shelter.
The unidentified object is\Ncoming towards us.
We’ve got it on visual.  I’m\Nputting it on the main screen.
It’s been fifteen years, hasn’t it?
Yes.  Well, now we’re sure.
It’s the Angels.
Every missile hit the target!
I’m sorry!  Were you waiting long?
The target is still operational!  It’s still\Nheading towards Tokyo-3!
The Air Defense Force doesn’t have the\Nfirepower to stop it!
Hit it with everything we’ve got!\NMobilize all the units from Atsugi...
...and scramble the squadrons\Nfrom Iruma as well!
Forget about the budget!\NDestroy the target at any cost!
Why?!  That was a direct hit!
The tank battalion’s been annihilated.
Guided missiles and artillery\Nhave no effect either.
Damn it!  We gave it everything we’ve\Ngot and we’re not even touching it!
Is it protected by an AT Field?
Yes.  Conventional weapons are\Nno match for the Angels.
Yes sir, I understand.  We’ll execute\Nthe plan at once.
Hey, wait a second...
They’re going to use an N2 mine?
Get down!!
We did it!!
Sorry, but it looks like you won’t\Nbe getting a shot at it.
Shock wave approaching.
Are you all right?
Yeah... but my mouth is full of dirt.
That’s okay.  Now then... let’s go!
Push!
There...
Thanks for the hand.  I really\Nappreciate it.
Thank you too, Miss Katsuragi.
Just Misato is fine.
I’m glad we’ve met at last, Shinji Ikari.
Yeah...
What’s the target’s status?
We’re unable to confirm due to all the\NEMP interference.
It must have been finished.  You saw\Nthe size of that explosion.
Sensors restored.
We’ve got an energy reading at the\Nexplosion’s epicenter!
It can’t be!
Visual display restored.
That was our last resort...
No effect, I can’t believe it!
It’s a goddamned demon!
Yes.  Don’t worry about it.
His safety is my top priority, so could\Nyou get a car train ready for us?
The express one.
Right.
Well, I volunteered to pick him\Nup, so it’s my duty to make sure\Nhe gets there.  See ya!
33 more loan payments to go,\Nplus the cost of repairs...
Excuse me... Misato?
Huh?  What?
Are you sure you can just take those?
Never mind about that.
It’s an emergency, and we need a\Nworking car right now, right?
And I am a government official, after\Nall, so everything’s going to be\Nperfectly fine, okay?
I don’t think anyone will buy that.
Don’t get so snotty.  You’re not as\Ncute as I thought you were.
You think so?
Oh, did I upset you?
Sorry, sorry!  You’re just a kid, after all.
So are you.  You’re not as mature\Nas I thought you were.
As we predicted, it’s regenerating itself.
If it couldn’t, it wouldn’t be a practical\Nautonomous invasion weapon.
Impressive.  It appears it can even\Nupgrade its own operational functions.
And it’s also getting smarter.
It will renew its assault any minute now.
The gates are now closing.\NPlease stand clear.
This is a B-22 Special Express\Ndeparting for G33-1
This is a B-22 Special Express\Ndeparting for G33-1
This train will bypass all other\Nstations.  Please stand back.
My teachers told me that it was\Nimportant to the safety of\Nthe human race.
From this point forward, command of\Nthis operation will be entrusted to you.
Show us that you’re capable.
Yes sir.
Mr. Ikari, we must admit that our\Nweapons have no effect on the target.
But are you sure you can\Nbeat these things?
It’s what NERV was created for.
We’re all praying that you’re correct.
The target is still stationary.
Our current ability to intercept\Nis only 7.5%.
Even the UN forces are exhausted.
What are you going to do?
I intend to activate Unit 01.
Unit 01?  But we have no pilot.
That’s not a problem.  Another spare\Nwill be delivered soon.
Are you taking me to my father?
Yes.  Yes, I think so.
Oh, yes...  Didn’t you get an\NID card from your dad?
Yes.
This is it.
Thanks.
Here, read this.
NERV...
Am I going to work for him?
Of course.  He wouldn’t have sent\Nme a letter unless he needed\Nme for something.
Hmm, it looks like you don’t get\Nalong with your dad.
It’s the same with me.
Awesome!
It’s a real Geo-Front!
That’s right.
This is our secret base.\NNERV Headquarters.
This is the key to rebuilding our world...
...a fortress for all mankind.
What on earth?  Isn’t this\Nthe right way?
And where in the heck is Ritsuko?\N\N\N
I’m sorry.  I’m just not used\Nto this place yet.
We passed this spot just a\Nlittle while ago.
Don’t worry about it.  And anyway,\Nthey make these systems to be\Nused, you know.
Would the chairperson of Project E,\NTechnical Department Division 1,\NDr. Ritsuko Akagi, Dr. Ritsuko Akagi...
...please contact Captain Misato\NKatsuragi of Operations,\NDivision 1, immediately.
I don’t believe it.
Has she gotten lost again?
Uh, hiya, Ritsuko...
Why are you wasting my time,\NCaptain Katsuragi?
Aren’t you aware that we’re short on\Nboth time and manpower?
Sorry!
Is this the boy?
Right.  According to the Marduk\NReport, he’s the “Third Child.”
I’m glad to meet you.
What?  Uh... sure.
He’s just like his dad... the\Nunfriendly part, that is.
Handle the rest of this.
Their first meeting in over three years...
Vice-Commander, the target has\Nstarted moving again.
Right.  Assume\Nbattle stations, level one.
Repeat.  Battle stations, level one.\NPrepare for ground-unit interception.
Here we go.
It sounds pretty serious.
So, how’s Unit 01 doing?
It’s currently undergoing refrigeration,\Nusing the B-type equipment.
Does it really work?  It’s never\Nworked before, has it?
The possibility of activation is\N0.000000001%.
We call it, pathetically\Nenough, the O-9 System.
Does that mean it doesn’t work?
Oh, don’t be insulting.\NIt’s “O,” not “zero.”
Well, it’s just a number.  Anyway, it’s\Na bit too late to be saying\N“Sorry, it didn’t work.”
Huh?  It’s so dark.
A face?  A giant robot?
You won’t find this in the manual.
This is man’s ultimate-humanoid\Nfighting machine...
...the first model of the synthetic life\Nform Evangelion, Unit 01.
Built here in secret, it is\Nmankind’s last hope.
Is this part of what my\Nfather’s been doing?
Correct.
It’s been a while.
Father...
We’re moving out!
Moving out?!  Unit 00’s\Nstill in cryostasis, isn’t it?
Wait a second... You’re going\Nto use Unit 01?
There’s no other way.
Now wait... Rei can’t do it yet, can she?
We’ve got no pilot!
One’s just been delivered.
Are you serious?
Shinji Ikari...
Yes?
You will pilot it.
But... even Rei Ayanami took seven\Nmonths to synchronize with her Eva.
It’s impossible for him to do it!\NHe just got here!
He just has to sit in the seat.  We\Ndon’t expect more than that.
But...
Repelling that Angel is\Nour ultimate priority.
If putting someone who has a chance of\Nsynchronizing into an Eva unit...
...gives us even the slightest chance,\Nthen we have to do it.
You do understand that, don’t\Nyou, Captain Katsuragi?
I suppose...
Father, why did you send for me?
You know exactly why.
So, you’re asking me to take this thing\Nand go out there and fight?
Precisely.
No way!  How can you do\Nsomething like this to me?
I knew you didn’t want me!
I called you because I have\Na need for you.
Why me?
Because no one else can.
No, I can’t...  I’ve never even seen\Nanything like this before!  I can’t do this!
You will be instructed.
But... there’s no way!
I can’t pilot it!
If you’re going to pilot it, do it now\Nand quickly.  If not... leave!
It must have detected our location.
Shinji, we don’t have any time.
Get into it.
No!  I didn’t come for this!\NThis is all wrong!
Shinji...  Just why did you come here?
You must confront your father and\Nyou must confront yourself.
I know it!  But I just can’t!
Fuyutsuki...
Wake up Rei.
Can we use her?
She isn’t dead.
I understand.
Rei.
Yes?
Our spare is unusable.\NYou will do it again.
Yes sir.
Reconfigure Unit 01’s system to\NRei, then reactivate!
Roger.  Call off the present work,\Nand begin reactivation.
Watch out!
The Eva moved!
How could it?!
It broke off the right arm-restraint!
No, that’s impossible!
It didn’t have an entry plug inserted!
It’s not possible!
It reacted without any interface...?
Or... was it protecting something?
It protected him?
We can do it.
Let me do it.
I’ll pilot it.
Cooling process, completed.\NRight arm repairs, completed.
Cage now in position for docking.
Signal plug terminator has been ejected.
Roger.  Inserting entry plug.
Plug fixed in place.
Connecting Unit 01.
Filling the entry plug.
W...what is this stuff?
Don’t worry.  Once your lungs are\Nfilled with LCL, your blood will\Nbe oxygenated directly.
You’ll get used to it.
I feel nauseous.
Stop whining!  You’re a\Nboy, aren’t you?!
Connecting main power.
All circuits transmitting power.
Roger.
Connecting secondary contacts.
A-10 nerve connection, normal.
Configure the language logic\Ninterface for Japanese.
All preliminary contacts established.\NPerformance nominal.
Bidirectional circuits are open.
Synchronization ratio at 41.3%.
Amazing.
Harmonics are all normal.  No\Ndisturbances identified.
We can do it.
Prepare to launch!
Prepare to launch!
Disengage primary lockbolts!
Disengage confirmed.  Disengaging\Nthe umbilical bridge.
Disengage secondary lockbolts.
Disengage primary restraints.
Disengage secondary restraints.
Release safety locks\Nnumbers 1 through 15.
Internal batteries fully charged.
External battery outlet, normal.
Roger.  Move Eva Unit 01\Nto the ejector pad.
Launch path is clear.\NAll systems green.
Ready for launch.
Roger.
Can we really do this?
Of course.
Unless we defeat the Angels, we\Nhave no future.
Ikari, are you sure about this?
Launch!
Eva triumphs over the Angel!
However, this is just the beginning.
Misato decides to save Shinji, who ran\Naway from his father’s place...
...insisting that he not be left alone.
But that was simply arrogance.
That night, Shinji closes his mind.
Next episode: “Unfamiliar Ceiling.”
I’ll make you a bargain\Nnext time, too.

Are you ready, Shinji?
Yes.
Release the final safety lock!
Evangelion Unit 01, lift off!
Shinji, just concentrate on\Nwalking right now.
Walk...
It walked!
Walk...
Shinji, are you okay?
Hurry!  Get up!
Shinji, calm down!  That’s not your arm!!
What’s going on with the Eva’s\Ndefense system?!
The signal’s not working!
The field’s not unfolding!
Have we failed?
Left arm damaged!!
The circuits have snapped!
Shinji, dodge!
There’s a crack on the front\Nof the brain case!
The armor won’t last any longer!
The head’s been damaged!  Extent\Nof damage, unknown!
The control nerves are breaking off!
We’re not getting any readings\Non the pilot!
Shinji!!!
This ceiling is unfamiliar.
So, the Angels have returned, eh?
It’s so sudden.
It’s the same as it was fifteen years ago.
A disaster comes as it will,\Nwithout warning.
On the positive side, our previous\Ninvestments will not go to waste.
You can’t be sure about that yet.
If it doesn’t pay off, it’s a waste\Nall the same.
Correct.  Now that the Angels have\Nbecome common knowledge...
...we have to manipulate the\Ninformation to avoid trouble.
NERV must take care of\Nthese matters quickly.
It’s already been taken care of.\NYou may rest assured of that.
Of course we are.
Well, we must acknowledge that.
Speaking of which, Mr. Ikari, isn’t there\Na better way to utilize NERV and Eva?
We’re referring to the repair costs for\NUnit 01, which when added to the\Ncosts for Unit 00...
...are enough to bankrupt\Nan entire country.
We also understand that you gave that\Nparticular toy to your son, did you not?
Manpower... time... and money...
How much more will be wasted by you\Nand your family?
And that is not your only responsibility.
The Human Instrumentality Project...
...that should be your top priority.
Correct.
Under these desperate circumstances,\Nthat project is our only hope.
Do you understand?
In any case, the Angel is no excuse for\Ndelaying that project’s schedule.
However, we will consider\Nadjusting the budget.
Now, the rest of this meeting\Nconcerns only us.
Your presence here was\Nappreciated, Mr. Ikari.
Ikari, you do understand there can\Nbe no turning back, don’t you?
I know.
Mankind has no time left.
Air conditioning has just got to be\Nmankind’s greatest treasure.  It’s the\Ntriumph of science over nature.
Shinji’s woken up.
And... how is he?
No external injuries.  His memory is a\Nbit muddled, however.
You don’t think it could\Nbe brain damage?
The doctor said that there was\Nnothing to worry about.
Really?
I suppose.  He did have a\Npretty hectic day.
His cranial nerves must have\Ntaken a lot of strain.
Don’t you mean... his heart?
Okay, go on.
Yeah, that way.  Stop.
If Eva and this city both operate at\Ntheir full potential, maybe we can\Nmake it through this.
Are you going to defeat the Angels?\NYou’re always such an optimist.
Hey, sometimes you need a little wishful\Nthinking just to keep on living.
I see your point.  Your attitude makes\Nme feel a little more at ease.
See ya!
Dr. Ugai, Internal\NDepartment 1...
Dr. Ugai, Internal Department 1, please\Ncall Dr. Azuma of the 1st Surgical\NDepartment immediately.
The medical conference on the B\Nexperiment will be held as scheduled.
All supervisors please proceed to\Nconference room 2.
Are you sure?
They don’t want to live together?
I think that living apart is natural for\NIkari and his son.
And being together is unnatural?
Alone?
Right.  His room will be in the 6th\Nblock, just beyond this one.
Is that satisfactory?
Yes.
Are you sure?
Shinji...
It’s fine.  Being alone is\Nokay with me.
I’m alone anyway.
Whaaaat?!
So, I said, I’ll take care of Shinji.
I’ve already got permission\Nfrom the brass.
Hey, it’s not like I’m going to\N“put the moves” on him.
Of course you’re not!
How could you even think of\Nsuch a thing?
You’re always like that.  Shame on you!
Well, we’ll have to have a\Nparty tonight, huh?
What for?
What for?  A welcoming party for my\Nnew roommate, of course!
So, you’re going to move after all?
Yes.  I’d never have dreamt that this city\Nwould become a battlefield.
Yeah...
My husband’s saying that our kid and I\Nshould move, at the very least.
Don’t I know it.
This city may be a fortress, but that’s\Nno guarantee of safety.
Just remembering it gives me the chills.
Really.
I hope you don’t mind if we make\Na little stop on the way.
Where?
Someplace really cool.
So desolate.  This city seems so lonely.
It’s time.
Cool!  The buildings are growing!
This city is a fortress, designed\Nto protect from the Angels.
This is Tokyo-3...
This is our city.
And... it’s the city that you saved.
Your things should have already\Nbeen delivered, Shinji.
I just moved into this apartment, too.
Come on in.
Pardon... the intrusion...
Shinji...  this is your home now.
I’m...  I’m home...
Welcome home.
Um, as you can see, the place is a\Nlittle bit messy...
Make yourself comfortable.
You call this...
...a “little bit” messy?
Oh!  Sorry!  Could you put\Nthe food in the fridge?
Uh... sure.
Ice...
Snacks...
And tons of beer...
What kind of a life does she lead?
Excuse me... what’s in the other fridge?
Oh, don’t mind that.  He’s\Nprobably still sleeping!
Sleeping?
Let’s eat!
Let’s eat...
Life just doesn’t get any\Nbetter than this!
Don’t you want to eat?  It’s good,\Neven if it is all instant.
I’m sorry, I’m just not used to it.
That’s no excuse!  You can’t\Nbe so finicky.
No... that’s not what I... uh, well...
Isn’t this nice?
Having two for dinner instead of\Neating alone!
Uh... yeah.
Here we go.
Let’s go for the next one.
Paper, stone and scissors...
Pon!  Pon!  Pon!  Pon!
Sorry, Shinji.
Okay!  That was a pretty fair way of\Nsplitting our daily chores, right?
Yeah...
This is your home now, so make yourself\Ncomfortable and take advantage of\Neverything here... except me.
Y... yes.
Man... “Yes, yes, yes”... is that all you\Nsay?  It’s getting on my nerves.
You’re a boy, aren’t you?\NAct like a man!  Okay?
Y... yes.
Okay, that’s just the way you are.
Well, why don’t you go take a bath and\Nscrub away those bad memories.
Bathing cleanses both the\Nmind and soul.
M... M... Miss Misato!!
What?
A p... p... p...
What?
Oh, him?  He’s one of those new\Nwarm water penguins.
Th... th... that was a what?
His name is Pen Pen.  He’s your\Nother roommate.
Why don’t you cover that up?
Bathing cleanses both the\Nmind and soul.
...and Rei Ayanami.
So, how was Rei today?
You did see her at the hospital this\Nafternoon, didn’t you?
She’ll be ready to work again\Nin twenty days.
By then, we’ll be ready to reactivate\NUnit 00 from cryostasis.
It’s so hard on these poor children.
There is no one else who\Ncan pilot the Evas.
As long as they survive, that is\Nwhat I’ll have them do.
With no regard to what they may want?
Yeah, after all the horrible stuff he went\Nthrough, I doubt that he’ll pilot it again.
Maintaining him is part of\Nyour job, Misato.
I’m just scared.  I don’t know how\Nto deal with him.
Grumbling already?  It was your idea\Nto take him in, you know.
Shut up!!
...so why can’t I be happy about it?
This is your home.
The brain case has been damaged!\NExtent of damage unknown!
We’re having problems\Nmaintaining activation!
Status report!
The Synchrograph is reversing!\NThe pulses are flowing backward!
Break the circuit!  Block it!
We can’t!!
It’s not accepting the signal!\NIt won’t take it!
What about Shinji?
His monitors aren’t responding.\NHis condition’s unknown!!
Unit 01’s gone completely silent!!
Misato!!
We’ve got to stop this...
Abort the operation!  Rescuing the\Npilot is our first priority!
Eject the entry plug!
We can’t!  It’s completely\Nout of control!!
No way!
The Eva’s reactivating!
Impossible!  How could this happen?!
Impossible...!
A berserker...?
It looks like we’ve won.
An AT Field!
No!  As long as the Angel has that\NAT Field up...
...he can’t get near the Angel!
The left arm has been\Nregenerated!
Incredible!
Unit 01’s expanding an AT\NField of its own!
It’s neutralizing the phase space!
No, not neutralizing, it’s eroding it!
Unbelievable!  It went through that\NAT Field so easily...
No!  It’s going to self-destruct!
Is the Eva...?
That must be the Eva’s...
...true form.
Circuits reconnected.
Systems restored.  Graphs\Nback to normal.
Pilot life signs, confirmed.
Send out the recovery team.  Hurry!
Preserving the pilot’s life is\Nour first priority.
Shinji... can I come in?
I forgot to tell you something...
You did a very good thing today.
You should be proud of yourself.
Good night, Mister Shinji.
Hang in there.
Training as an Eva pilot.
A new life with Misato.
Shinji, who passes his life without\Nhaving himself, would surely never\Nhave a friend.
But when it’s revealed that he’s a\Npilot, he becomes a hero.
Shinji becomes embarrassed and\None boy bullies him.
Next episode:\N“The Phone That Never Rings.”
I’ll give you something special again.
Like an angel that has no\Nsense of mercy...
Rise, young boy, to the heavens\Nlike a legend.
Cold winds, as blue as the sea,
Tear open the door to\Nyour heart, I see.
But unknowing you seem, just\Nstaring at me...
Standing there smiling serenely.
Desperate, for something to touch...
A moment of kindness like\Nthat in a dream.
Your innocent eyes, have yet no idea...
Of the path your destiny will follow.
But someday you’ll become aware of...
Everything that you’ve got behind you.
Your wings are for seeking out a new...
Future that only you can search for.
The cruel angel’s thesis enters through\Nthe window of your soul.
If you should betray the chapel\Nof your memories.
The cruel angel’s thesis bleeds through\Na portal like your pulsing blood.
So, boy, stand tall and embrace\Nthe fire of the legend,
Embracing the universe like\Na blazing star!
Good morning, Shinji.  How’s it going?
No problems.  I’m getting used to it.
That’s good.  Have you memorized\Nthe positions of all the Eva\Nemergence points...
...emergency power junctions,\Narmament equipment buildings\Nand recovery zones?
I guess so...
Well, let’s review it now.
Normally the Eva runs off electricity\Nprovided by an umbilical cable.
In emergencies, it can switch to a\Nbuilt-in battery, with an active\Nlife of 1 minute at full power...
...and no more than 5 minutes\Nin the minimal activity Gain Mode.
This is due to our current technological\Nlimit in battery capacity.
Do you understand?
Yes...
Now let’s continue from where we left\Noff yesterday.  Initiate Induction Mode.
Position the target in the center...
...then squeeze the trigger switch “on.”
Take it easy.  Position the\Ntarget in the center...
Pull the switch...
Next!
You know, I can’t help but wonder\Nwhy Shinji agreed to be the pilot\Nafter what happened.
It would seem that he simply does\Nwhat he’s told to do.
I suppose that’s just his way of\Ngetting through life.
Target in the center... pull the switch.
Target in the center... pull the switch.
Target in the center... pull the switch.
Target in the center... pull the switch.
Target in the center...
And now, from Tokyo we go to\NNatsuko Shinohara in Matsuzaki.
Good morning, this is Shinohara.\NGuess what?
Today I’m in Matsuzaki in West Izu\Nfor a little scuba diving!
Today’s forecast is sunny, with an\Nestimated high of 32 degrees C.
We have hot days all year now, but we\Nused to have four seasons:
We never see snow these days, instead,\Ndue to the recent warmth...
...aquatic life has been coming\Nback little by little.
...makes me think of catching some\Nfor tonight’s dinner.
...sad memories, this is a hot diving spot.
Yes?  Hello?
Oh, it’s you, Ritsuko.
How’s it going?  Are you getting\Nalong with him?
Him?
Oh, Shinji.
Well, it’s been two weeks since he\Ntransferred into the school and he\Ndoesn’t seem to have changed.
No one ever calls him.
Calls him?
Well, since I figured he’d be needing\None, I gave him a cellular phone.
I don’t think he’s ever used it though,\Nor received any calls.
I’m not sure, but I don’t think he\Nhas any friends.
Well, I would guess that Shinji’s not the\Nsort who’s easy to make friends with.
Do you know the fable of the\N“Hedgehog’s Dilemma”?
Hedgehog?  You mean those animals\Nwith the spiny hair?
Even though a hedgehog may wish to\Nbecome close with another hedgehog...
...the closer they get, the more they\Ninjure each other with their thorns.
It’s the same with some humans.  The\Nreason he seems so withdrawn is\Nbecause he’s afraid of being hurt.
Well, he’s going to have\Nto learn someday...
...that part of growing up means\Nfinding a way to interact with others\Nwhile distancing pain.
What’s up, Class Rep?
Did you give him the printout I\Ngave you yesterday?
What?  Well...
Well, there wasn’t anybody home\Nat Toji’s place.
Mr. Aida, aren’t you\NMr. Suzuhara’s friend?
Aren’t you worried about him?
Do you suppose he’s injured?
What?  In that robot incident?!
The television report said\Nthat nobody was injured!
No way, you saw where the explosion\Nwas on Mt. Takanosu, didn’t you?
There were fighters scrambled from\NIruma and Komatsu...
...and there were also troops from\NMisawa and Kyushu.
I’ll bet at least ten or twenty\Npeople were injured...
...and there had to be some killed, too.
Toji!
Suzuhara!
Wow, has the class population\Ndropped or what?
They’ve all been evacuated or\Ntransferred to other schools.
After all, no one wants to stay after\Nthat last battle inside the city.
Yeah, you’re probably the only one\Nwho’s actually enjoying the chance\Nto see a real war.
Yeah, I am.
And speaking of which, where have\Nyou been, Toji?  Why were you\Nabsent so long?
Did you get involved in the war?
My little sister did.
She was crushed under a pile of debris.
She survived but she’s been in\Nthe hospital ever since.
Both my dad and grandad\Nare working at the lab...
...and there’s no way they\Ncan leave their posts.
So, if I’m not with her, she’s all alone.
That robot’s pilot was really dumb!\NIt makes me so angry!
How could he wreck our own city?\NWhat was he doing?
Oh, speaking of the pilot, have you\Nheard the rumor about the new\Ntransfer student?
What transfer student?
Him, over there.
He transferred here while\Nyou were absent.
He came right after the incident.\NDon’t you think it’s odd?
All rise!
And so, humankind was about\Nto face its greatest trial.
In the last year of the 20th century...
...a massive meteorite from outer space\Nslammed into the continent of Antarctica.
The continent’s ice cap was melted\Nalmost instantaneously.
The water level of the oceans increased\Ndramatically, the Earth was\Nthrown off its axis...
...and new, devastatingly\Nabnormal weather patterns\Nwere spawned.
The lives of all living things on the\Nplanet were threatened.
Several thousand species and half of\Nthe world’s human population were lost\Nin the immediate aftermath.
That was the so-called\N“Second Impact.”
The survivors still had to live through the\Nhell of worldwide economic collapse,\Nethnic conflicts, and civil wars.
However, it has been\N15 years since then...
In only 15 years, we have\Nrestored ourselves.
This is certainly proof of the human\Nrace’s resilience, but even more so...
...it is the fruit of the blood, sweat and\Ntears your fathers and mothers have\Ndedicated to this cause.
Whaaat?
Really?
Cool!
We’re still in class, you know!
Sit down now!!
Aw, you’re always so bossy!
Hey, come on!\NForget her!
Now cut that out!!
Cool, it’s awesome!
Well, umm...
Hey, how were you chosen?
Were there any tests?
Weren’t you scared?
What’s the cockpit look like?
Well, um...  I’m not supposed to\Ntalk about secret stuff...
Oh, come on.
Don’t be mean.
Hey, what’s the name of the robot?
I don’t know much, but everyone\Ncalls it Eva or Unit 01...
Eva?
And what’s its ultimate attack mode?
Uh... some kind of vibrating knife...
...an ultrasonic wave...
That’s amazing!  We’re so proud of you!
Yeah, right!  Cool!  Yeah.
And thus...
Oh...
Hey, you guys, why don’t you at least\Nshow some manners at the end...
Sorry, newcomer, but I’ve got\Nto beat you up!
I’ve got to work off my anger.
Sorry, his sister was injured\Nbecause of the incident.
That’s his excuse, anyway.
I didn’t... pilot it by choice...
We’ve got an emergency call...
I’ll go.
A special state of emergency\Nhas been declared...
...for the Kanto and Chubu regions\Nsurrounding the Tokai district.
All residents must evacuate to their\Ndesignated shelters immediately.
Repeating: a state of emergency\Nhas been declared...
The target has been sighted by our\Ncameras.  It’s already penetrated into\Nour territorial waters.
Assume battle stations, level one.
Roger, prepare for anti-aircraft\Ninterception.
Tokyo-3 transforming to\Nbattle formation.
Initiate accommodation of\Nthe central block.
Accommodation of central block and\Nthe first through seventh districts\Nhas been completed.
Notification of the government and\Nother related ministries, completed.
Present effective rate of anti-aircraft\Ninterception: 48%.
What’s the status of\Nnoncombatants and civilians?
We’ve already received reports that\Nthe evacuation has been completed.
Attention elementary school and junior\Nhigh school students: please form\Ngroups with your individual classes.
Area residents, please group according\Nto your block numbers.
It’s news censorship.  They won’t show\Nany of it to us civilians...
...even though it’s an incredible event.
The Fourth Angel would show up while\NCommander Ikari is away.
It’s a lot sooner than we expected.
The last time they gave us\Na 15-year break.
This time it’s been only 3 weeks.
They never care about our\Nsituation, do they?
They’re the kind we women\Nhate the most.
It’s a waste of the taxpayers’ money.
The committee is demanding that we\Ndispatch an Evangelion again.
Oh, they get on my nerves.
If they hadn’t asked for it, I’d\Nhave mobilized it anyway.
Entry procedure initiated.
LCL oxygenated.
Releasing airlock.
Hey, I need to talk to you,\Nprivately, you know?
What for?
Just give me a second, okay?
Well, okay.
Class Rep!
What?
We both have to go to the bathroom!
You were supposed to use the\Nbathroom before you came here.
So, what’s this about?
I’ve got to see it, at least once in my life.
You mean the battle up there?
Nobody knows when the enemy will\Ncome the next time...
Kensuke, are you serious?
If we let this opportunity escape us,\Nwe may lose it forever!
Please, help me unlock the gate.
But you could get killed if\Nyou go out there.
If we stay here in the shelter, who’s to\Nsay that the risk isn’t the same?
If I could be killed anyway,\NI’d rather see it first.
You idiot.  What do you\Nthink NERV’s for?
And what is NERV’s most\Nimportant weapon?
It’s the robot the new kid pilots.
He protected us the other day...
...but you hit him pretty hard.  Twice!
If he refuses to fight, we’re\Nall going to die.
Doesn’t that make it your obligation\Nto watch him fight?
Okay, you’re not leaving\Nme any options!
You’ll do anything to get what\Nyou want, won’t you?
Shinji, are you ready?
Yes.
First, neutralize the enemy’s AT\NField, then fire a volley.
Do it just like we practiced.\NCan you handle that?
Yes.
Launch!!
Cool!!  All my efforts really paid off!
This is it!
There it is!
Do it just like we planned, okay, Shinji?\N\N\N
Right.
You idiot!  You hid the enemy with\Nyour own smoke!!
I can’t believe it!  He’s already losing!
Not a problem.
I’m sending you a spare rifle.
Take it!
Shinji?  Hey, Shinji?
Jesus...
Being beaten up must have really\Nmessed him up.
S...shut up!
The umbilical cable’s been snapped off!
Eva has switched to its internal\Nbattery power source.
4 minutes, 53 seconds of\Nactivation remaining.
It’s coming this way!
Shinji, are you all right?  Shinji!
Damage report?
No problems detected.  He can make it.
Shinji’s classmates?
What are they doing there?
Why won’t he fight?
Because we’re here?
He can’t move because of us!
Activation time remaining:\N3 minutes 28 seconds.
Shinji, let them into the cockpit!
Once you’ve got them, make a\Ntemporary retreat.  We’ll start\Nagain later!
What makes you think that unauthorized\Ncivilians can be allowed into\Nthe entry plug?!
I’m authorizing it.
You’re exceeding your authority,\NCaptain Katsuragi!
Unit 01’s remaining activation\Ntime: 3 minutes.
Hold Eva on your current commands\Nand eject the entry plug.  Hurry up!
You two!  Get in!  Now!
What the...?  It’s water?
My camera!  My camera!
Abnormal conditions occurring in\Nthe nervous system.
Of course.  It’s because you’ve allowed\Ntwo foreign bodies into the matrix!
They’re being detected as noise in\Nthe nerve impulse systems!
Retreat!  Now!
Utilize recovery route 34, retreat to\Nthe east side of the mountain.
I mustn’t run away!
Progressive knife engaged!
Obey my orders, Shinji!\NYou’ve got to retreat!
Shinji!
That idiot...
Unit 01, activation time\Nremaining: 30 seconds!

Eva Unit 01, activation ceased.
The target is completely silent.
It’s been three days...
You mean, since we were chewed out?
No, since he stopped\Ncoming to school.
Who’s “he”?
The new kid, of course.
I wonder what he’s been\Ndoing since then?
Are you worried about him?
No, not exactly worried...
Toji, for someone who’s so tactless,\Nyou’re pretty stubborn.
If you had apologized to\Nhim back then...
...you wouldn’t have had to agonize\Nover it for three days.
Here, this is the new kid’s phone number.
If you’re so worried, why don’t\Nyou call him?
As the dreary rain pours down, Shinji,\Noverwhelmed and unable to overcome\Nhis weaknesses...
...tries to run away from Misato.
It’s acceptable, however, considering\Nthat he’s only fourteen.
The organization brings the aimlessly\Nwandering Shinji back.
There are no kind words waiting to\Nease his feelings...
...except from the two boys.
It’s the next episode, “Rain, Escape\Nand Afterwards.”
And of course, I’ll give you lots of fan\Nservice next time too!

Shinji, wake up!  How long are you\Ngoing to keep skipping school?
It’s been five days now.  Unit 01 has\Nalready been completely repaired.
You’re the pilot, are you going to\Njust leave it like that?!!
Shinji?!
He’s run away...\NThat’s not too surprising...
Shinji?
Well... uh...
We’re Shinji’s classmates, Aida\Nand Suzuhara, ma’am.
Aida and Suzuhara...?
Yes, ma’am.
Yes!!  I... I’m Suzuhara.
Aren’t you the boys who got in\NUnit 01’s entry plug?
Yes, ma’am.
Yes, ma’am.  We’re sorry for\Ncausing so much trouble.
The reason we came here today...
...is that Ikari’s been absent ever since\Nthen.  So, we came to see if he was okay.
Shinji...  He’s at the NERV training\Nfacility right now.
Oh, I see.
These are the printouts that were\Nbuilding up on Shinji’s desk.
Oh, sorry for your trouble.  Thank you.
Well, we’ll be leaving now.
Please say “hi” to Shinji for us.
Uh, yeah.  I will.  Bye.
This is an unexpected development.
She was a real babe, wasn’t she?
Shinji, you idiot!!
Jerk!
The next station is Nagao Toge,\NNagao Toge.  The exit will switch\Nto the right side.
Thank you for using the Tokyo-3 Loop\NLine.  This train will be going out of\Nservice at this station.
Please, make sure you take all of your\Nbelongings with you as you exit the train.
I’ve got to go back.
Hey there!  We’ve got some great\Ndeals!  Hot young babes serving\Nheavenly refreshment!
Special services to heal your tired body,\Nservices to fill you with energy!
You really couldn’t detect it, Doctor?!!
Yes.  An object only ten millimeters in\Ndiameter crashed into Antarctica at\Nclose to the speed of light.
The technology we had was unable to\Npredict or prevent such a thing.
It’s like hell out there!  Just what is\Nthe purpose of science?!
The atmospheric flux caused by the\Nchange in the Earth’s axis has\Ndecreased by 3%.
So, it’s getting a little better?
No, there’s still a tidal wave\Napproaching at 230 meters a second!
Doctor!  We must evacuate!!
It’s my duty to remain here.
Doctor, choosing death is easy, but\Nyou have an obligation to watch\Nthis living hell!!
Idiot.
He’s only 14 years old...
It seems so cruel, making him bear the\Nburden of mankind’s destiny.
We have no choice.  We have to use\N14-year-olds to pilot the Evas.
I know.
So, has he called or made contact?
Nothing?
Nothing.  I don’t think he’s going\Nto come back again.
What are you going to do?
Nothing really...
If he’s not going to come\Nback, that’s okay too...
Why?
Because of what happened\Nafter that last battle...
Why did you ignore my order?
I’m sorry.
I’m the one who’s in charge of your\Noperations, right?
Yes.
You’re supposed to obey my orders,\Nyou know!  Do you understand?
Yes.
I’m warning you, never do it again.
Yes.
Do you really understand\Nwhat I’m saying?!!
Yes.
Hey, you’re not going to get out of this\Nby just saying “yes” to everything I say.
I know that.  That’s enough, isn’t it?\NWe won the battle anyway.
You know, it may seem easy to go along\Nwith whatever anyone else wants...
...but if you get into the Eva with that\Nattitude, it’ll kill you!
I don’t care.
It’d be nice if I could say you’ve\Ngot the right attitude...
...but if you think you’re going to get\Nany praise out of me, you’re\Nwrong, Shinji Ikari.
That’s not the point.  In any case, I’m the\Nonly one who can pilot it, aren’t I?
I’ll do it.
I see...
If piloting an Eva means nothing\Nbut pain to him, he shouldn’t\Nget into it again.
Otherwise, I’m sure he’ll get killed.
But we need pilots.
Captain!!
Aida, go on ahead!!
But I can’t go and leave you behind!
You fool!
No!
There!
The new kid?
Ikari!
Toji was sorry about that.
He said that his kid sister scolded\Nhim and said that “it was the robot\Nwho saved our lives!”
That’s pretty embarrassing, being\Nchewed out by a second grader.
Right?
I like it at night because those noisy\Ncicadas don’t chirp.
I remember that it was pretty quiet\Nwhen I was a kid but there have been\Nmore and more of them each year.
The ecosystem is returning\Nto its former state.
That’s what Misato said.
I see, Misato said so.
I really envy you.  Living with such a\Nbeautiful woman and piloting the\NEvangelion.
Oh God, I wish I could get behind\Nthe controls just once!
You shouldn’t.  I think your mother\Nwould be worried.
Oh, don’t worry about that.\NI don’t have one.
I’m the same as you.
You’ll have something to eat, won’t you?
Yeah.
Do you usually do this sort of thing?
Umm... well, sure.
Is this some kind of training for\Nguerrilla warfare or something?
How could I fight with toys like\Nthose?  It’s just for fun.
You’re Shinji Ikari, aren’t you?
Yes.
We’re from NERV Security Intelligence.
Under Article 8 of the Security Act,\Nwe’re taking you to NERV Headquarters.
All right?
Yes.
And all you did was stand there?
That’s easy for you to say!  But it’s\Nlike I said, they were NERV Security\NIntelligence... professionals.
So what?!  Don’t you have any\Nballs at all?!
Sissy!
Pervert!
Ape!
Only an idiot fights when he knows he\Ncan’t win.  Balls have nothing\Nto do with it.
Long time no see.
Yes.
Do you feel any better after\Nwandering around for two days?
I don’t know...
The Eva is on standby.  Will you pilot it?
Or won’t you?
You’re not going to scold\Nme for running away?
Of course not, I’m no relation\Nto you, am I?
If I say that I won’t pilot Unit 01,\Nwhat will you do with it?
I suppose that Rei will do it.
Won’t you pilot it?
It seems unrealistic for you to\Nforce everything on her.
Don’t worry.  I’ll pilot it.
But you don’t want to do it?
Of course not.  To begin with, it’s not\Nsomething that comes to me naturally...
...but Ayanami, Miss Misato\Nand Miss Ritsuko...
Cut that out!
This has nothing to do with any of us!
If you don’t like it, get out of here!  Just\Nforget all about Eva and us and go\Nback to where you came from!
We don’t need someone with\Nthat attitude piloting.
The Third Child is leaving\NTokyo-3 tomorrow.
Then we’ll reconfigure Unit 01’s\Nsystem for Rei.
But...
Regardless of the results of the Unit 00\Nreactivation experiments, we’ll move\Non to experimenting on Unit 01.
According to the Marduk Institute’s\NReport, the Fourth Child hasn’t\Nbeen found yet.
That means we can’t get\Nany pilot recruits?
Excuse me, where is Miss Misato?\NI’d like to say goodbye.
You’re no longer NERV personnel.
Therefore, we can’t give you\Nany information.
Ikari!!
You left this stuff behind, Ikari!
Could you excuse me a moment...?
Well, thank you.
Hey, Toji.
Come on, say something!
Ikari, I’m sorry I hit you twice.\NPlease, hit me back!
I can’t do that.
Please!  Otherwise, I won’t be satisfied.
See?  He’s a pretty embarrassing\Nguy isn’t he?
But if it’ll put an end to this dispute,\Nwhy don’t you go ahead and hit him?
But...
Hurry up!  You don’t have much\Ntime, do you?
Okay, but only once...
Okay!  Come on!
Hold it!!
Stop.  Don’t hold back.
Right.
Ouch...
How did you know I’d come here?
It was just a hunch.  We’ve seen dozens\Nof classmates off before.
If you’re leaving, we’ll have to leave\Nthis city sometime soon, but...
...we can’t blame you for that.  We saw\Nhow you suffered in the Eva.
And if anyone tries to blame you...
...I’m gonna give them a headbutt!
Hey, don’t look so gloomy.
Take care.
Take care.
Well...
Your time is up.
I’m the one who deserves to be hit!  I’m\Nmean, cowardly, dishonest and weak...
...sneaky and... a sissy...
Don’t give us any more trouble...
He’s gone.
Do you really think this is for the best?
The “Hedgehog’s Dilemma”... the closer\Nwe become, the more deeply we\Nhurt each other...
Now I understand.
That boy...
He can’t let others know how he\Nfeels in any other way.
The Express Linear Train, bound for\NAtsugi, is arriving on Track 2.
For your safety, please step back to the\Narea inside the yellow lines.
The train arriving on track 2 is for\Nspecial government use only and\Ndeparts at 4:20 for Atsugi.
No civilians are allowed\Ninside the fence.
Please be aware that the boarding of\Nthis train by unauthorized persons\Nis strictly prohibited.
Hang in there.
Hey, look!
Hey, it’s that babe!
The local train bound for Gora is now\Narriving on track 4.  For your own safety,\Nplease stay inside the yellow lines.
If you’re accompanying small children,\Nplease ensure that they are properly\Nsupervised.
The train arriving on track 4 is the\Nlocal shuttle to Gora, departing at 4:32.
If this is your train, please step inside\Nand wait until departure.
The train is now approaching.\NPlease stay behind the yellow line.
I... I’m home.
Welcome home.
Rei Ayanami limits her association with\Nothers as much as possible.
The only one she seems to open up\Nto is Commander Ikari.
Shinji is at a loss to understand how\Nthis girl can be closer to his own\Nfather than he is.
But before he can settle his mind on this\Nsubject, a beam shot by the Fifth Angel\Nmelts Eva Unit 01’s chest!
Shinji’s scream reverberates\Nin Misato’s ears.
It’s the next episode,\N“Rei, Beyond Her Heart.”
Like an angel that has no\Nsense of mercy...
Rise, young boy, to the heavens\Nlike a legend.
Cold winds, as blue as the sea,
Tear open the door to\Nyour heart, I see.
But unknowing you seem, just\Nstaring at me...
Standing there smiling serenely.
Desperate, for something to touch...
A moment of kindness like\Nthat in a dream.
Your innocent eyes, have yet no idea...
Of the path your destiny will follow.
But someday you’ll become aware of...
Everything that you’ve got behind you.
Your wings are for seeking out a new...
Future that only you can search for.
The cruel angel’s thesis enters through\Nthe window of your soul.
If you should betray the chapel\Nof your memories.
The cruel angel’s thesis bleeds through\Na portal like your pulsing blood.
So, boy, stand tall and embrace\Nthe fire of the legend,
Embracing the universe like\Na blazing star!

Rei, are you all right?
Rei!
I see.
Rei Ayanami, age 14.
The first of the test subjects chosen in\Naccordance with the Marduk Report.
The First Child.
She is the designated pilot\Nfor Evangelion Unit 00.
Her past has been eradicated.  All of\Nher personal records have been erased.
So, what was the cause of that accident\Nduring the last experiment?
We still don’t know...
However, we believe that mental\Ninstability on the part of the pilot\Nwas a primary cause.
Mental instability?  In Rei?
Yes...  Her mind became more\Ndisturbed than we had anticipated.
So, what did happen?
I don’t know...
But she could have...
Did something occur to you?
No, that can’t be...
The demolition of block B-3\Nhas been completed.
All technical department personnel\Nare to submit their data to the\Nanalysis group.
So, this is our enemy...
I see.  Everything except the core\Nhas been left intact.  This is a\Nperfect sample.
Thank you, this will help us a lot.
So, did you find anything new?
What the heck is this?
That’s the code number for\N“cannot be analyzed.”
You mean, you don’t know what this is?
Correct.  What we do know is that\Nthe Angel is composed of...
...a type of matter characterized\Nby both particulate and wave form\Nproperties, not unlike solidified light.
But you’ve at least found its power\Nsource, haven’t you?
Something like that, anyway.
But we haven’t been able to figure out\Nany of its operating principles.
So, we’ve finally found something\Ncompletely outside our experience.
The world is filled with mysteries.
For example, take a look at this.
This is the Angel’s inherent\Nwave pattern.
What?  Let me see...
Could it be...?
Yes.
Although they are composed of a\Ndifferent form of matter, their\Nactual composition...
...in terms of the arrangement and\Ncoordinates of the pattern, fall within\Na 99.89% match of a human being.
Unbelievable... 99.89%...
Once again, we must acknowledge\Nhow limited our level of\Nunderstanding is.
Keep it going... stop.
This is the core?
How’s the rest of it?
It’s pretty deteriorated.  We can’t\Nexpect to use it as a reference.
That’s not a problem.  Dispose of\Nthe remnants.
Yes, sir.
What’s wrong?
Well, um...  nothing’s wrong...
You know, are you aware that when\Nyou say “nothing” that way...
...it’s the same as asking others to pay\Nattention to you?
Well... it’s just that my father seems to\Nhave burned his hands...
Burned?
I was just wondering how it happened...
Burns...?  Do you know\Nanything about them?
It was before you arrived\Nhere at NERV.
Unit 00 went berserk during the\Nactivation experiments.  You’ve\Nheard about that, right?
Yes...
The pilot was trapped inside it...
Ayanami was the pilot, wasn’t she?
It was Commander Ikari who rescued\Nher.  He opened the super-heated hatch\Nwith his bare hands.
My father did that...
That’s how he burned his hands.
Go Hideko!
You lose!!
You’ve got to treat us to pizza\Nif you lose!!
There, go on!
You won’t make it!
Now, let’s sink a shot!
Oh my gosh!  Those guys are\Nlooking at us!
Pervert!
Man, they’ve all got such\Nincredible breasts...
Suzuhara’s ogling us!  Gross!
Hi, Shinji!!
Hey, Big Shot!
What’re you looking at so intently?
Uh... Nothing!
I think you’re looking\Nat Ayanami!  Right?
No.
Oh, come on, dude.  Am I stupid?
Ayanami’s boobs...
Ayanami’s thighs...
Ayanami’s...
...calves!
I told you, it’s nothing like that.
Then what were you looking at?
You can’t fool me.
I was just wondering why\Nshe’s always alone.
Uh... come to think of it, she hasn’t had\Nany friends since she started here in\Nthe 7th grade.
There’s just something about her\Nthat makes her hard to talk to.
She’s probably just got a\Nlousy personality.
You two are both Eva pilots, right?  You\Nought to know her better than any of us.
He’s right.
Well, I’ve hardly spoken to her.
Eva Unit 01 is now entering the third\Nstage cooling process.  Lower all\Nsystems to phase 3 in Cage 6.
The earlier harmonics and\Nsynchronization tests were all good.
All numerical conditions\Nhave been satisfied.
Roger.  Transmit the result to Balthasar.

What is this?!!
It’s curry.
So, you’re still eating this instant stuff.
Look, you’re a guest so you’ve got\Nno right to complain.
Here Misato...
Oh, here.
Here, put all of that into this.
Are you serious?
Oh, don’t you know how good this is?
Okay...
Ordinary curry flavored instant\Nramen can’t be this good.  Yeah.
Let’s eat!
The trick is to put less hot\Nwater in the soup.
You cooked this, didn’t you Misato?
Good gosh...
Oh, can you tell?
Yes, by its taste.
Next time, invite me when\Nit’s Shinji’s turn.
Shinji, you really ought to move.  You\Nshouldn’t let one bad roommate\Nruin your life.
I’m used to it now.
He’s right, Ritsuko.
Never underestimate the ability of\Nthe human animal to adapt to\Nits environment.
And anyway, if he does move...
Shinji, why don’t you bring me\Nanother one, please.
Right.
He’s going to have to go through a lot\Nof trouble and red tape.  He just got\Nhis permanent security card, you know.
Oh, I almost forgot!
Shinji, would you do me a favor?
What is it?
Rei Ayanami’s renewal card.
I keep forgetting to give this to her.
Would you mind delivering this to her\Nbefore you go in to headquarters?
Sure.
What’s the matter?  You’re staring\Nat Rei’s picture, aren’t you?
No...
Oh, I think you are, Shinji.
No!
Oh, come on!  You’re embarrassed,\Naren’t you?
Well, you’ve got an official excuse\Nto go to Rei’s place now.
That’s a great chance, don’t you think?
Stop teasing me!
But I love teasing you.\NYou always go ballistic!
Just like Misato.
I just find it strange that I know so little\Nabout Ayanami, even though\Nwe’re both Eva pilots.
She’s a very nice girl, but she’s like\Nyour father.  She’s not very adept at...
Not adept at what?
Living.
Excuse me?
Excuse me, it’s Shinji Ikari.
I’m coming in, Miss Ayanami!
Are these hers?
Um... well...
I didn’t mean...
Will you get off?
Uh... I...
What?
Well, I mean... I was...
I... I was asked to, so...
What was it... the card, your card...
It’s been renewed...
So, I was asked to deliver it...
I didn’t mean for any of\Nthis to happen...
Ritsuko said she forgot to\Ngive it to you...
It’s true.  I rang your bell, but there\Nwas no reply... and the door was\Nunlocked... so...
Central Dogma is currently open\Nto the public.
Group 3 should proceed directly\Nto the fourth gate.
This is your new card.  Ritsuko told\Nme to deliver this to you.
I’m sorry...
About what?
Um, aren’t you going to have a\Nreactivation experiment today?
Say, aren’t you scared?
Aren’t you... afraid of\Npiloting... Unit 00?
Why?
Well, I heard that you were hurt pretty\Nbad in an earlier experiment,\Nso I thought you might be...
Aren’t you Commander Ikari’s son?
Yeah.
Don’t you have faith in your\Nown father’s work?
Of course not.  How could I trust him...
What?
Rei, are you all right?
Rei...
The pilot was trapped inside it.
It was Commander Ikari\Nwho rescued her.
He opened the super-heated hatch\Nwith his bare hands.
That’s how he burned his hands.
Rei...
Can you hear me?
Yes.
We shall now commence the Unit 00\Nreactivation experiment.
Commence first connection.
Connecting main power supply.
Activation voltage has passed\Nthe critical point.
Roger.
Shift format to Phase 2.
Connecting pilot to Unit 00.
Open circuits.
Pulse and harmonics are normal.
No problems detected.
In synch.  All links completed.
Central Nerve System elements\Nare nominal.
Recalculating, no error corrections.
Checklist is satisfactory up to 2590.
Approaching the critical mark...

Borderline cleared.
Unit 00 has been activated.
Roger.
Beginning interlock test.
Ikari, an unidentified object is\Napproaching.  It may be the Fifth Angel.
Stop the test.  Go to first stage alert.
You’re not going to use Unit 00?
She’s not ready to fight yet.  What’s\Nthe status on Unit 01?
It’ll be ready in 380 seconds.
Engage!
Yes, sir.
Rei.
Reactivation has been successfully\Ncompleted.  Return now.
The target is passing over Tonosawa.
Unit 01 is beginning launch\Npreparation.
Releasing primary lockbolts.
Release confirmed.
Roger.
Removing secondary restraints.
Roger.
The target is now intruding into\NLake Ashino airspace.
Eva Unit 01 is ready for launch.
Launch!!
We’re detecting a high energy\Nreaction from inside the target!
What?!
It’s accelerating and massing\Nupon itself!
Is it possible...?
No, dodge it!!
Shinji!!
Shinji is saved, but after being\Ninjured, he deteriorates badly.
Rei is forced to kick off of him in\Nthe heat of battle!
Meanwhile, Misato desperately tries to\Npinpoint the Angel’s weak spot with\Nthe ultimate in heavy artillery.
Will Shinji’s prayers and all of the\Nenergy in Japan be enough to penetrate\Nthe Angel’s shields?
Unit 00 is fused by the molten impact!
It’s the next episode,\N“Showdown In Tokyo-3”!

We’re detecting a high energy reaction\Nfrom inside the target!
What?!
It’s accelerating and massing\Nupon itself!
Is it possible?
No, dodge it!!
Retrieve him, hurry!!
The target has gone silent!
How’s Shinji?
He’s alive!
Unit 01 has been recovered.\NSend it to the 7th cage.
I’m going to the cage.  Take over\Nfor me, please!
Unit 01 secured!
The pilot’s brain waves are\Nextremely erratic!
His cardiac readings are very weak.
Increase the power to the life support\Nsystems.  Give him a heart massage.
Roger!
Pulse confirmed!
Force eject the entry plug!  Hurry!
Emergency LCL discharge!
Roger!
Come on, open the hatch!  Hurry!
Shinji!!
The enemy’s accelerated particle beam\Ncannon has hit the balloon!
The decoy has been vaporized!
Next.
The Type 12 Mortar has\Nbeen vaporized!
I see.
From the data we’ve collected, we’re\Nassuming that the Angel automatically...
...attacks any opponents that come\Nwithin a certain range.
There’s a 100% probability that\Nanything that enters that range\Nwill be targeted.
It is too risky for close range\Ncombat in an Eva, isn’t it?
What’s the status of its AT Field?
It’s still active.
It’s strong enough that the spatial\Nchanges in phase are visible.
Using conventional means of attack,\Nguided missiles, artillery and bombs...
...would inflict more damage on us\Nthan on the Angel!
Yeah, offensively and defensively it’s\Nalmost perfect.  A real flying fortress.
What’s the status on its drill?
At this moment the target is directly\Nabove us, penetrating the\NTokyo-3 Null Zone.
A giant shielded drill,\Nwith a diameter of 17.5 meters,\Nis boring towards NERV HQ.
The enemy is going to attack NERV\NHeadquarters directly.
Sassy bastard!
What’s its ETA?
00:06.54 AM, just after midnight.
By that time, it will have breached all\N22 levels of defensive armor and will\Npenetrate NERV Headquarters itself.
Less than 10 hours...
The drill has contacted\Nthe first armor plate.
What’s the condition of Unit 01?
The defensive armor was melted\Ndown to the third layer...
...but the good news is that the central\Ncontrol unit sustained no damage.
Given three more seconds, it would\Nhave shot right through the Eva.
It will take three hours to install\Nreplacement parts.
Roger.
What’s the status of Unit 00?
Reactivation itself should prove\Nno problem, but there’s still a\Nfeedback error remaining.
So, it wouldn’t...
...survive combat.
What’s the condition of Unit 01’s pilot?
No physical damage.
However, nerve pulses are up by 0.8.
That’s still within acceptable limits.
Enemy arrival: 9 hours, 55 minutes.
Talk about your high\Npressure situations.
Why don’t we raise a white flag?
Before we resort to that...
...there’s one little thing I’d like to try.
You want to use a sniper to shoot the\Ntarget from outside its firing zone?
Yes sir.
Instead of trying to neutralize\Nthe target’s AT Field...
...I believe a pinpoint shot with a\Nfocused high-energy beam is\Nthe only way.
What do the MAGI say?
The responses from the MAGI\NSupercomputers were 2 affirmative and 1\Nconditional affirmative.
Our probability of success is 8.7%.
It’s the highest value we could get.
I see no reason to reject your plan.\NYou may proceed, Captain Katsuragi.
Yes, sir.
You know how crazy this whole\Noperation is, don’t you, Operations\NDirector Katsuragi?
Don’t be rude, it’s not crazy.
It can be executed within the 9 hours\Nwe have left and has the highest\Nchance of success.
It does?  Really?
But our positron rifle can’t handle\Nsuch a high output.
What are you going to do about that?
We’ll borrow one, of course.
Borrow one?  You don’t mean...?
Yeah!  The Strategic Self Defense\NForce Lab’s new prototype!
NERV is hereby requisitioning\Nthis Prototype Self Propelled Positron\NCannon as of 15:00 today.
But this is ridiculous.
We’ll try and return this in as close to\Nits original condition as we can.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Okay, Rei!  Take it away!
Be careful.  That’s a piece of\Nprecision machinery.
But our calculations show that it will\Ntake at least 180 million kW to\Npenetrate that AT Field.
Where are you going to get\Nthat much electricity?
You know.  From all over Japan.
We apologize for interrupting our\Nregular programming for this\NEmergency Bulletin.
From 11:30 PM tonight...
...until tomorrow morning,\Nthere will be...
...a large scale power blackout\Nthroughout most of Japan.
We appreciate your cooperation.
Repeat, from 11:30 PM tonight,\Nuntil tomorrow morning...
...there will be a large scale power\Nblackout throughout most of Japan.
We appreciate your cooperation.
The drill has just broken through the\Nseventh defensive layer.
What’s the status on the\Nenergy supply system?
3.2% behind schedule, but we should\Nbe finished by 23:10.
And the positron rifle?
For the honor of Technology\NDevelopment Department Section 3...
...we’re betting that we’ll have it\Nbuilt in three hours.
And how’s our defense coming?
Well, using a shield is about\Nall we can do.
So, is this the shield?
Yes.  It was part of a single stage\Ntrans-orbital rocket.
It may look ugly, but it’s got an\Nelectromagnetic base coating\Nthat Section 2 guarantees...
...will stand up to the enemy’s particle\Nbeam for at least 17 seconds.
Good.  Have you determined\Nthe sniper position?
Given the position and distance of the\Ntarget, and taking geographical\Nfeatures and access to...
...power transformers into\Nconsideration, this position\Nwould be our best choice.
Right.  Looking good.
Our sniper will attack from the\Ntop of Mt. Futago!
The operation will commence at 00:00\Ntomorrow morning.
From this point on, this operation will\Nbe called “Operation Yashima.”
Roger.
Now, the only remaining problem\Nis the pilot.
Unit 01’s designated pilot\Nis conscious now.
His examination results look normal.
Good, then the operation will\Nproceed as planned.
Roger.
But...  I wonder if he’ll pilot it again.
Let’s get to Mt. Futago now!
Ayanami...
I’m here to brief you on the Operation\NYashima timetable.
The operation will begin at\Nmidnight, 00:00 hours.
Prior to that, pilots Ikari and Ayanami\Nwill arrive at the cage by 17:30.
At 18:00, Unit 01 and Unit 00\Nwill activate.
At 18:05, both units will be deployed.
They will arrive at the temporary base\Non Mt. Futago at 18:30.  There, they\Nwill await further orders.
The operation will begin immediately\Nafter midnight.
This is the new one.
Don’t show up looking like that.
Sorry.
I’ve been apologizing since yesterday...
Your meal.
I don’t want to eat anything...
We’ll be departing in 60 minutes.
Do I really have to pilot Eva again?
Yes, you do.
I don’t... want to.
You can be so cool about it\Nbecause you haven’t had the kind\Nof experiences I’ve had, yet.
I don’t want to go through it again.
Then you can just stay here, bedridden.
What do you mean by that?
I’ll pilot Unit 01.
Dr. Akagi is already prepared to\Nrewrite the personal data files\Nfor Unit 01.
Ritsuko is...?
I’m leaving now.  Captain Katsuragi\Nand Dr. Akagi are waiting for me\Nin the cage.
Goodbye.
They’re really late.  We ought to\Nevacuate to the shelter.
I hacked into my dad’s data files.
I’m sure this is the time.
Why aren’t they here then?
The mountain is moving...
The Evangelions!
Cool.
Go for it, Evangelions!!  We believe\Nin you!!  Beat the Angel!!
The drill has penetrated through\Nthe 17th layer of armor.
It will reach headquarters\Nin 3 hours 55 minutes.
Power supply transfer from Shikoku\Nand Kyushu areas completed.
Beginning tests of each cooling system.
This is a very delicate piece of\Nmachinery!  Handle it carefully.
This thing wasn’t built for field\Noperations.  Will it really work?
Point taken, but we have no choice.\NThis was the most expedient way of\Nachieving our goal.
Are you sure it’s safe to use?
Theoretically, yes.
However, we’re not sure if the cannon\Nbarrel and accelerator will be able to\Nhandle the stress or not.
This is the first time it’s ever been fired\Nwith such a high power output behind it.
Here are the battle plans\Nfor the operation.
Shinji...
Yes.
Your Unit 01 will be the gunner.
Right.
Rei, you will cover him with Unit 00.
Right.
The reason for this arrangement is\Nbecause Shinji has a higher synch\Nratio with Unit 01...
...and this operation will require an\Nexceptionally high degree of precision.
Since the positron beam will be\Ninfluenced by the Earth’s gravity,\Nmagnetic fields and rotation...
...it will not fire in a straight line.
You must remember to adjust for these\Ndeviations.  You must penetrate\Nthe core precisely.
But I’ve never... practiced this!
Don’t worry...
...just do what the manual says.
As soon as the indicators in the\Ncenter converge, just pull the trigger.
The computers will handle the rest.
Also, be aware that before you can fire\Nthe rifle a second time...
...you will first have to wait for the\Nunit to cool, then replace the\Nfuses and reload.
And if I miss or the enemy shoots back?
Don’t think like that.
You must destroy it with your first shot.
I...
...I am just to defend Unit 01,\Nis that correct?
Yes.
Understood.
It’s time.  Get geared up.
Right.
Maybe...
...this will be our last day alive.
Why do you say that?
You won’t die.
I’ll protect you.
Why do you pilot this?
Because I’m bonded to it.
Bonded?
Yes, it’s a bond.
You mean... to my father?
To all people.
You’re very strong, Ayanami.
I have nothing else...
What do you mean you “have\Nnothing else”?
It’s time.  Let’s go.
Goodbye.
The time is now 00:00.
Commencing operation.
Shinji, we’re entrusting you with the\Nenergy of the entire nation of Japan.
I’m counting on you.
Roger.

That shield can’t last long!
Are we ready yet?!
10 more seconds.
Hurry up!!
Hurry up!!
We made it!!
Ayanami!
Ayanami!
Are you all right?!
Ayanami!
Don’t say... don’t say that you\Nhave nothing else...
Don’t say “goodbye” when you\Nleave on a mission.  It’s too sad.
Why are you crying?
I’m sorry.  I don’t know what I should\Ndo or feel at a time like this.
Why don’t you try smiling?
NERV isn’t the only agency that’s trying\Nto find ways to combat the Angels.
However, when the giant humanoid\Ntype robot created by a civilian\Ncorporation...
...goes out of control during its\Nofficial test trial...
...it’s up to Eva Unit 01 to catch\Nthe rampaging Jet Alone.
Will Misato be able to stop its\Nnuclear reactor from melting down?
It’s the next episode,\N“The Human Creation.”
And of course, I’ll give you lots of\Nfan service next time too!
Like an angel that has no\Nsense of mercy...
Rise, young boy, to the heavens\Nlike a legend.
Cold winds, as blue as the sea,
Tear open the door to\Nyour heart, I see.
But unknowing you seem, just\Nstaring at me...
Standing there smiling serenely.
Desperate, for something to touch...
A moment of kindness like\Nthat in a dream.
Your innocent eyes, have yet no idea...
Of the path your destiny will follow.
But someday you’ll become aware of...
Everything that you’ve got behind you.
Your wings are for seeking out a new...
Future that only you can search for.
The cruel angel’s thesis enters through\Nthe window of your soul.
If you should betray the chapel\Nof your memories.
The cruel angel’s thesis bleeds through\Na portal like your pulsing blood.
So, boy, stand tall and embrace\Nthe fire of the legend,
Embracing the universe like\Na blazing star!
Once again, I owe you.
You’re not going to pay me\Nback anyway, are you?
Regarding the materials they demanded\Nunder the Freedom of Information Act...
...I handled it by giving them\Nsome falsified data.
The government is proceeding with\Nlegal action, but that will be\Nblocked any day now.
So, should I do something about\Nthat project as well?
No, judging by the material you sent\Nme, it would appear that there will\Nbe no need for that.
Then I’ll continue with the plan.
Good morning.
G’morning.
This’s the way to start your morning!
Not with coffee?
Look, a traditional Japanese breakfast\Nbegins with rice, miso soup, and sake.
Not all Japanese breakfasts,\Njust Misato’s.
What’s that supposed to mean?
Come to think of it, who was supposed\Nto do the cooking today?
Now I know why you’re still\Nsingle at your age, Misato.
Well, excuse me, but are you\Nsaying that I’m lazy?
And sloppy too.
Leave me alone!
I’m done.
Are you really going to come\Nto school today?
Of course, it’s your parent–teacher\Nmeeting, after all.
But you’re so busy with your work.
No problem.  This is part of my\Nresponsibilities, anyway.
It’s part of your job, huh?
Hi!
Oh, thanks for coming!  Yes, he’s\Ngetting ready.
Misato, you shouldn’t go out like that.
It’s embarrassing.
I know.
Good morning, Mr. Ikari!
We’re taking off now, Misato!
Take care!
Come on!
How ironic...
It’s good that it’s getting easier\Nfor him to express himself.
Yes?
He’s just left.  Please stand\Nguard over him.
There!  She came!
Cool!  Who is she?
Is she Ikari’s guardian?
What?  He’s got a babe like that\Nfor a guardian?!
Those guys are dorks.
She’s gorgeous, truly gorgeous!
Is that so?
It’s amazing that someone so\Nbeautiful could be NERV’s\NDirector of Operations.
Is that so?
Yeah, Shinji’s no rival for us!\N\N\N\N\N
Man, I wish she were my girlfriend.
Yeah, and you’d have to put up\Nwith a lot of trouble.
You just don’t get it, do\Nyou, Mr. Big Shot?
Okay, you can handle keeping the\NEarth safe and peaceful...
...and we’ll take care of Misato!!
The entry plug smells a lot like blood.
What’s the status of Unit 00’s\Nbio-chest components?
It was seriously damaged.
So we’ll have to make an entirely new\None, even though it’s close to\Nour ancillary budget.
Will our job get any simpler once\Nwe get Unit 02 from Germany?
It could go just the other way.
Disposing of the dead Angels\Ncosts a bundle.
Yeah, this place is ridiculously\Nunderfinanced...
...especially since mankind’s future\Nrests on what we do here.
It can’t be helped.
“Man cannot live by Eva alone.”
All those survivors need\Nmoney to live, too.
Money!
So, is the Commander off to\Nanother conference?
Yes, he’s on board and en route now.
Thank God, a little peace and quiet.
Excuse me, do you mind if I sit here?
The revised budget for the sample\Ncollection passed quite\Neasily, didn’t it?
The committee’s main concern is for\Ntheir own survival.
They aren’t stingy when their\Nown lives are at stake.
Yes, they used to think there\Nwere no more Angels.
But I have more good news.
All permanent members of the Security\NCouncil except the United States...
...have approved the budget\Nfor Eva Unit 06.
It’s just a matter of time before\Nthe US approves it as well.
The Americans seem to be allergic\Nto unemployment.
And what about your country?
We will participate beginning with\Nthe construction of Unit 08.
The plans for the second installation\Nproject are still viable.
However, a pilot has not\Nyet been found.
The Angels have returned.
We have no choice but to defeat them.
We do not want a repeat of\Nthe Second Impact, either.
So, you’re saying that the Second\NImpact that evaporated\NAntarctica wasn’t...
Yes, the history texts say that\Nit was a disaster caused by a\Nmassive meteorite...
...but sometimes the true facts have\Nbeen concealed.
Fifteen years ago, in Antarctica,\Nmankind discovered the being\Nknown as the first “Angel.”
In the middle of the investigation,\Nhowever, for unknown reasons,\Nthe Angel exploded.
That is the real truth about\Nthe Second Impact.
Then, the things we’re\Ndoing here are to...
...to prevent a probable Third Impact\Nfrom happening.
That is the purpose of NERV\Nand the Evangelions.
By the way, the demonstration will\Noccur tomorrow, as scheduled.
I understand.
Good morning!
G...good morning.
I’m going to Old Tokyo on business.
I’ll probably be getting back late\Ntonight, so have something\Ndelivered for dinner.
See ya!
O... okay.
It is hard to believe that this place\Nused to be the flourishing capital\Nknown as Tokyo.
We’re here.
Why are they having it in\Na place like this?
Is the DF getting involved?
The Strategic Self Defense Force?\NNo, they’re not allowed to interfere.
I see, so that’s why they can do\Nwhatever they like.
Good afternoon, welcome to this\Ndemonstration...
...of Japan Heavy Chemical Industrial\NCooperative’s new product.
Thank you for attending.
You will be observing the official\Ndemonstration from the control room...
...but we’ll be taking your\Nquestions here.
Yes...
Ah, the famous Dr. Ritsuko Akagi.
It is our honor to have you here.
May I ask a question?
Of course, certainly!
According to our earlier briefing, this\Nunit is equipped with an internal\Nnuclear reactor.  Is this correct?
Yes, this is one of our product’s most\Ndistinguished features.
150 consecutive days of operating\Npower is assured.
But, from a safety perspective...
...isn’t incorporating a nuclear reactor...
...in a land-based weapon designed\Nfor hand-to-hand combat, risky?
It’s more practical than a weapon that\Nwon’t work for more than five minutes.
But in an emergency there could be\Nproblems with remote control.
But it’s more humane than a system that\Ninduces tremendous mental stress and\Ncauses mental instability.
Cut it out.  This just makes\Nyou look childish.
And there’s still the issue\Nof manual operation.
A weapon that cannot be\Ncontrolled is insane.
I believe that it is safer than...
...an extremely dangerous weapon...
...that can run out of control\Nand go berserk.
It’s like a hysterical woman!
In other words, completely\Nout of control!
Our pilots and technology are up to\Nthe task of controlling it.
So, you’re saying that science and\Nhuman courage will tame that\Nhideous beast?
Are you serious?
Yes, of course I’m serious!
And because it depends on something\Nas vague as the human heart...
...NERV has allowed the situation to get\Ncompletely out of control.
As a result, the UN has had to\Napprove an enormous supplement\Nto your existing budget.
And as a result of that, 20,000 people\Nin several unnamed countries\Nare starving to death.
Of course, the actual cause of all this\Nis still under investigation.
Why don’t you at least take\Nresponsibility for your handiwork?
I envy you.  How fortunate it must\Nbe for NERV to be protected by\Na super-legal act.
It doesn’t matter what you say, the fact\Nis that NERV has the only weapon\Ncapable of defeating the enemy.
You mean the AT Field?
It is just a matter of time now.
NERV’s day in the sun\Nwill not last forever.
Damn it!  Idiot!\NWho does he think he is?!
That SOB’s just pissed at being\Ncut out of the profit loop!
That goddamn son of a bitch!!\NDamn it!  Damn it!
Cut that out, behave yourself.
He’s just a show-off, begging for\Npraise and adulation.
He’s petty, not worthy of attention.
But how did he know about\Nthe AT Field?!!
How could something so\Nclassified leak out?
Intelligence must be dragging its ass.
We’re about to start the JA activation\Ntest.  Don’t worry, there’s no risk at all.
Please, make yourselves comfortable\Nand watch through that window.
Ready to begin.
Start the test.
Discharge the power core.
Pressure levels, nominal.
Coolant system circulation, nominal.
Release the control rods.
The reactor has exceeded\Nthreshold levels.
Output is nominal.
Begin walk cycle.
Walking.  Forward ahead, slow.\NForward right leg.
Roger.  Walk, forward ahead slow.
Forward right leg.
Balance is nominal.
Power core status, nominal.
Roger.
Now, forward left leg.
Keep her steady.
It walks!  Now that’s something\Nto be proud of.
What’s wrong?
This is odd.  The pressure inside the\Nreactor is increasing.
The temperature of the primary\Ncoolant system is also rising!
Open the release valve.
Insert the neutron-deceleration fluid.
No effect!
The pump output isn’t increasing!
Shut off the power.  Emergency stop!
Abort signal transmission confirmed.
It’s not accepting it!
The radio circuit is being blocked!
It’s out of control!!
It can’t be!
No!  Oh, God!  Run away!
That robot is as badly behaved as\Nthe guy who built it.
The compression valve is\Noperating irregularly!
The control rods aren’t working!
Possibility of meltdown imminent!
It’s unbelievable...
JA’s been programmed to handle all\Npossible contingencies!
This kind of thing can’t happen!
Yet, the fact is, the danger of a\Nmeltdown is now before us!
Under the present circumstances,\Nour only option is to wait for it\Nto stop itself.
And what is the estimated probability\Nof an automatic stop?
0.00002%!  We’d better hope\Nfor a miracle!
Determined efforts are better\Nthan a miracle!
Tell me how to stop that thing!
We’ve tried every possible option.
Not yet.  There’s got to be a last resort,\Na way to wipe everything out.
Give me the password.
The password to delete all\Nprogramming is top secret.
I can’t authorize it.
I’m not allowed to tell you!
Then get the clearance!
Right now!!
It’s me.  Let me speak to\NMr. Manda in Tokyo-2.
That’s right, the Director\Nof Internal Affairs.
Well, I’ll have to delegate\Nthis to Mr. Yasugi.  Ask him.
I can’t give you authorization for such\Nan important matter orally.
Could you submit a written request?
So, now I need to get\NMr. Yoshizawa’s permission?
What?  Yes, I’ve already got an\Napproval from Mr. Witz.
Yes... yes, okay.
The evasion of responsibility...
A written order of clearance\Nwill be sent.
That will make this an\Nofficial operation.
We can’t wait for it to get here!  Once\Nthe thing explodes it’ll be too late!!
Jet Alone is heading for Atsugi.
Time is running out.
I’ll take responsibility for this myself.
Excuse me.
Hey, Hyuga?
I’ve already made arrangements with\NAtsugi.  Bring Shinji and Unit 01 with\Nthe F Equipment.
Yes, this is an emergency.
This is pointless.  Call this off,\NCaptain Katsuragi.
Do you have any idea how to stop it?
By inputting a direct\Ncommand manually.
Are you serious?
Yes.
But the interior must be flooded\Nwith radioactivity!
It’s too risky!!
But if I make it, everyone will be saved.
The hatch can be opened manually\Nas soon as our command\Nsignal is cut off.
You’ll be able to enter through\Nthe backpack.
“Hope.”
That’s the password to delete\Nthe programming.
Thank you.
JA is the target.
There’s a danger of meltdown\Nin five minutes.
Therefore, we cannot allow it to get\Nany closer to a populated area.
Hyuga?
Yes ma’am?
As soon as you drop off Eva,\Nascend to a safe altitude.
Affirmative.
And Shinji...
Yes.
Run alongside the target and\Nplace me on its back.
Then restrain the target\Nas best you can.
Are you going to get inside?
Yeah.
That’s crazy!
I know, but there just isn’t\Nany better way.
But it’s too dangerous!
No problem.
Eva can withstand a direct explosion.
Not that!  I meant for you, Misato!
Well, I’ve got to give it my best shot...
...or else I’ll regret it for the\Nrest of my life.
Target sighted.
Here we go.
Eva approaching drop position.
Docking release!
Roger!
We’ve caught up with it!
We’ve got less than 4 minutes.\NPut me on, now!
Don’t think!  Just do it!
Misato!!
Be careful.
Talk about hot.
This looks bad.
Stop, you bastard!!
Misato!  Hurry!
I’m here.
Error?
What the hell is this?
There’s no doubt!  The program\Nmust have been altered!
The power reactor is just 0.2 points\Nshort of critical!
The control rods won’t function!
Guess I’ll try the long shot.
Misato, get out of there!!
Move, move damn you!!
Misato!
0.1 to critical!!
My God!!  It’s going to explode!!
Christ, it’s all over.
Misato!!
She made it!!
Internal pressure decreasing!!
All readings are nominal!!
We’re saved!!
Hooray, hooray!  She’s done it!
That crazy fool.
Misato, are you all right?!
Misato?!!!
Yeah, I’m okay, not in the\Ngreatest shape however.
You’re alive!  I’m so glad!  You’re all\Nright!  You’re really all right!
Oh, thank heaven.  I’m so impressed!\NIt’s a miracle!!
Yeah...
Recovery of Unit 01 is complete.
No danger of radioactive\Ncontamination.
Except for Captain Katsuragi’s\Noperation, everything went\Naccording to the plan.
Good work.
G’morning...
Now, let me at that shower!
Where’s my bra and panties?
Good morning, Mr. Ikari!
Good morning.
I’m taking off!
See ya!
Misato is just so cool.
I thought so too, but she’s sloppy,\Nembarrassing and lazy\Naround the house.
She’s not embarrassed\Nabout it, but I am.
How nice for you.
What do you mean?
He really is a kid.
Yeah, he sure is.
How come?
She lets you see the side of her that she\Nwouldn’t show to anyone else, right?
That means she’s your family.
Eva Unit 02 and its pilot have left\NWilhelmshaven to come to Japan!
With this aggressive girl, Shinji once\Nagain experiences trouble in\Ncommunicating...
...and a surprise Angel attack forces\Nthe now activated Unit 02 into an\Nunderwater battle!
Can Misato triumph with the\Nentry plug in chaos?
It’s the next episode, “Asuka Strikes!”
Watch for it!

Correct, I have already arranged\Nit with the committee.
The cargo left from Sasebo Port\Nyesterday, and is now making its\Nway here across the Pacific Ocean.
A MIG-55 D transport helicopter!!
I’d never have believed I’d get a\Nchance to fly in one.
Thank God I have a buddy\Nlike you, Shinji!
Well, I thought you guys would be\Ngetting sick of being cramped up\Nin the mountains...
...so I just invited you on a date!
What?!  Today is really a date?
I bought this cap for today, Misato!
Where are we headed?
We’ll take a little jaunt across the\NPacific with a gorgeous cruiser.
Wow!!  One, two, three, four, five...
...aircraft carriers and four battleships!!
Whatta fleet!  I am absolutely sure\Nthe best thing in life is having\Na great buddy!
That’s your “gorgeous cruiser”?
Yeah, she sure is gorgeous!
That’s the pride of the UN,\Nthe glorious regular carrier\N“Over the Rainbow”!
It’s huge.
I’m surprised that such a relic\Nis still afloat.
Naw, it’s not so bad.
It’s a vintage model from just before\Nthe Second Impact.
Damn, give me a break!
That ruffian’s gone and brought the\Nsocket for the kid’s toy, so the little\Ngophers can run amuck!
Ohh!!  Cool!  Awesome!
Cool!  Incredible!!
Cool!  Mega-cool!  Wow!
This is way too cool!!
This kind of thing brings a tear\Nto the heart of a real man!
Cool!  Awesome!  Neat!  Wow!  Wow!
No!  Hey, wait!  Wait!
Damn it!
Stop!  Stop, now!!
Hello, Misato.
How have you been?
Fine, how ‘bout you?  You’ve grown\Nsome, haven’t you?
And how!
I’m not just taller, my figure’s\Nfilled out as well.
Let me introduce you.
This is the designated pilot of\NEvangelion Unit 02, the Second Child...
...Asuka Langley Soryu.
What did you do that for?!
That’s the viewing fee.  Quite a\Nbargain, don’t you think?
What?  You think it’s worth that?!\NHere, take a look at mine!
You insolent dork!!
So, which one is the famous\NThird Child?
Don’t tell me it’s him.
Don’t worry, it’s him.
Well, he looks kinda dull.
I thought you were the leader of this\Ngang of boy scouts...
...but I was obviously mistaken.
Thank you for your\Nunderstanding, Captain.
Oh, no, thank you for giving me the\Nopportunity to baby-sit even more kids\Nafter such a long time.
Well, thank you for your assistance\Nin the marine transport of Eva Unit 02.
Here are the specifications for the\Nemergency power supply socket.
In the first place, I’d never approve any\Nrequest to activate that toy while at sea.
Why don’t you just think of it as being\Nprepared for an emergency?
That’s why the Pacific Fleet\Nis guarding it.
When did the UN transform us\Ninto a bloody cargo service?
If my memory serves me correctly,\Nit was just after a certain\Norganization was established.
Guarding a toy!  What a ridiculously\Ngrandiose assignment for the entire\Nline of the Pacific Fleet!
It’s still not enough, not when you\Nconsider the importance of the Eva.
Would you sign this document?
Not yet, Eva Unit 02 and its pilot have\Nbeen entrusted to us by the Third\NBranch in Germany.
I won’t let you just waltz in and do\Nas you please!
Then when will you transfer them to us?
Once we’ve unloaded\Nin New Yokosuka.
The ocean is our jurisdiction.
You will follow our orders here.
I understand.
However, I should remind you that, in\Nthe case of an emergency, our, NERV’s,\Nauthority overrides yours.
She’s cool!
She looks like Ritsuko...
Well, you’re as gallant as always.
Kaji!
Mr. Kaji, I must insist that you not invite\Nyourself to the bridge.
Oh, sorry about that.
Well, excuse us.  Transport us to\NNew Yokosuka, as ordered.
I can’t take anymore!  Those kids are\Nreally going to save the Earth?
The times have changed.
I understand that Congress has pinned\Nits hopes on that robot as well.
On that toy?  Idiots.
If they’ve got money to blow on that,\Nthey ought to give a little more to us.
What are you doing here?!
Accompanying her.
I’m on a business trip from Germany.
Man, was I careless.
I should have anticipated this.
Hey!  Don’t touch me!
I can’t help it!
This has got to be a bad joke.\NNo, a nightmare.
So, what do you think about\NMister Shinji Ikari?
He’s boring.  That’s the great Third\NChild?  What a disappointment.
And yet, his synchronization ratio\Nwas well over 40% in combat,\Nwith no prior training.
That can’t be true!
That captain’s attitude\Ngets on my nerves.
He’s got a lot of pride.
Too much pride’s bound to make\Nhim cynical about us.
That Mr. Kaji is pretty... um, lively.
He hasn’t changed at all, that jerk.
Hey, Third Child!
Come with me!
Red?  I didn’t know that\NUnit 02 was red.
The color isn’t the only difference.
After all, Units 00 and 01 were created\Nas part of a developing process,\Nprototype and test type respectively.
The fact that it synchronized with an\Nuntrained pilot like you is proof of that.
However, Unit 02 is a little different.
Created for actual combat conditions,\Nthis is the world’s first true Evangelion.
This is the final model!
W... what’s that?
An undersea shock wave!
Something exploded nearby!
What’s that?
Is that... an Angel?!
Is that a real one?
Oh, my gosh.  We’ve got to go back\Nand find Misato...
This is my chance!
All ships maintain formation\Nand take evasive action!
Status report!
The Cymbeline’s gone silent.  The Titus\NAndronicus can’t locate the target!
Damn it!  What in the hell is\Ngoing on here?!
Hello, NERV delivery.
Would you like to order information on\Nthis enemy and countermeasures\Nto use against it?
This is a combat situation!  No\Nunauthorized personnel allowed!!
This is just my opinion, but I’d say this\Nmust be an Angel attack.
All ships, fire at will!
It’s pointless.
An AT Field can’t be penetrated with\Nthis kind of firepower.
But why is an Angel here?
My God, is it after Unit 02?
Where are you taking me?
Just wait there a second.
I can’t believe this.
Don’t peep, you pervert!!
Don’t peep, you pervert!!
Why are all boys such perverted jerks?
Here we go, Asuka.
Why won’t it sink?!
I knew it... only an Eva can beat it!
Let’s go.
Come with me!
Hey, what are these\Nentry plug suits for?
Are you dense?
We’re going to beat it with my Unit 02!
No way.  Do you have an\Napproval from Misato?
I’ll get permission after I’ve beaten it.
Now, I’ll show you how magnificent\Nmy piloting is!
Just don’t disturb me.
This is odd.  It seems to be\Nlooking for something.
I didn’t expect to see an Angel here.
This isn’t how it’s supposed to be, is it?
That is what Unit 02 is for...
...and I’ve generously provided a\Nsecond pilot as a reserve.
If worst comes to worst, you can\Nescape by yourself.
I know.
Program error?  What happened?
Thought noise!  I told you not\Nto disturb me.
What do you mean?
You’re thinking in Japanese aren’t\Nyou?  Think in German.
Oh, okay... strudel...
Idiot!
Fine, stop trying.  Switch the\Nlanguage to basic Japanese.
Evangelion Unit 02, activate.
Telex from the Othello!  Eva Unit 02\Nis in the process of activation.
What the...?!
Nice going, Asuka!!
No!  Abort the activation\Nsequence!  Reset it!!
I don’t care!  Asuka!  Go for it!
What are you doing?!  Eva and its\Npilot are under our control!
You’re violating my command authority!
What are you talking about?  This is\Nan emergency!  Who gives a damn\Nabout your procedures?
You’re not serious?  You do know that\NUnit 02 is still using the B equipment?
If we fall in the sea, we’re done for!
And if we don’t, we’ll be fine, all right?
Shinji, are you in there too?
Yes.
Kids!  Two kids!
This is a good opportunity...
Asuka, launch!
It’s coming!
Charge!
Where is it?
That way!
We’ve only got 58 seconds left!
I am well aware of that!  Misato!
Get the external power supply\Nsocket onto the flight deck.
I’ve got it!
What is she going to do?
Here we go!  Jump!
Jump?
Run!
The power socket is in place!
Reactor connection completed!
The deck is ready for Eva landing!
All hands, prepare for impact!
I can’t believe this!
Eva 02, landing on deck!
No!  Whatta waste...
Target is approaching rapidly!
It’s coming!  9 o’clock!
Switching to external power!
Switch completed.
But we don’t have any weapons.
The progressive knife should\Nbe good enough.
It’s bigger than I thought!
That’s what I figured!
What are they going to do?!
Hand-to-hand combat is the best\Nway to defeat Angels.
Good work, Asuka!
This isn’t a game!  Look at the mess\Nyou’ve made of the deck!
See?!  It’s sinking!
Asuka!
It’s impossible to fight underwater\Nwith the B equipment!
You never know...
...till you try!
What a waste!
How much cable is left?
1,200 meters more!
What are you going to do?
We can deal with it... somehow.
I’ve got to do something...
The cable’s going to run out!\NBrace for the shock!
Damn it!
Eva missed the target!
I’ve got to change the disk.
My God!  A Yak-38 Custom!!
Hey, Katsuragi!
Kaji!
I’ve got something to deliver,\Nso I’ll be taking off now...
Launch!
Take care of the rest of this,\NCaptain Katsuragi.
H... he ran away.  I don’t believe it!
The target is approaching Eva again!
It’s coming again!
I’ll finish it off this time.
What?!  It’s not working!
That’s because this is B type equipment.
What’re you gonna do?!
What am I gonna do?
You’re the Third Child,\Naren’t you?  Do something!
Here it comes!
A m...m...mouth?!
That’s because it’s an Angel.
Eva 02 has entered the target’s body.
Does that mean that the\NEva’s been eaten?
This is like fishing!
Fishing?  Yes, fishing!
From a bad situation to a worse one.
Hey, get off me already!
Hey, get off me already, you pervert!
But we’ve got to free ourselves.
Asuka, do you read me?
Don’t let go of it!!
Captain.
What?
I’m requesting your cooperation.
A point-blank assault by the\Ntwo surviving battleships?!
Correct.
We’ll sink two of the evacuated\Nbattleships on top of the umbilical\Ncable to set a trap.
When the Eva opens the target’s mouth,\Nboth ships will rush into the opening.
They will fire all of their bow turret\Ncannons and then self-destruct,\Ndestroying the target.
That’s absurd!
Absurd, perhaps, but not impossible.
I understand.
All hands abandon ship!  Repeat,\Nall hands, abandon ship!
The frigates will rescue the lifeboats!
But what about the Eva?
Not to worry.  They’ll be fine.
Hey!  Don’t use Unit 02\Nwithout my permission!
Do the two of you understand\Nthe operation?
I’ll do my best.
I’m counting on you.
All ships, open the Kingston valve!\NScuttle at point z.
Roger!
Cable reverse!
Eva has started to surface!
T-minus 70 to contact!
Hey, you’re touching my... get off!
But we’ve got to open its mouth\Nor we’ll be killed!
T-minus 60 to contact.
Status on the Angel’s mouth?
It’s still not open!!
Both battleships are sinking\Ntowards the target.
Eva is continuing to\Nsurface, T-minus 50 to contact.
No, it won’t open!
No time left!
Target has passed beneath the Tempest!
Hurry!!  Or you won’t make it!
Don’t get any strange ideas.
What?
Anyway, just concentrate\Non your thoughts.
You can say that again!
T-minus 20 to contact!
T-minus 15 to contact!
Fire!
Christ!  That was rather spectacular!
I had to improvise for underwater\Ncombat, I should have anticipated it.
It’s rare for you to regret something.\NIs this some kind of self-analysis?
Cut it out.  We’ve collected a lot\Nof valuable data.
Yeah...
Misato...
This really is something special.
P...pair of... look...
I don’t believe this.
They broke their synchronization ratio\Nrecords, didn’t they?
In only 7 seconds.  It must have\Nbeen due to the danger.
Hey, where’s Kaji?
He ran off earlier.  That idiot’s got to\Nbe back at headquarters by now!
It was a pretty eventful trip.
Was it caused by this, I wonder?
It’s already restored itself this far.
It’s frozen inside Dura-Bakelite,\Nbut it’s still alive.
This is the keystone of the Human\NInstrumentality Project, isn’t it?
Correct.
This is the first human being...
...Adam.
She may have looked cute, but she\Nwas a real bitch.
Well, we won’t have to see her again.
Yeah, ol’ Mister Big Shot has to\Nsee her at work though.
I’m really feeling sorry for you.
My name is Asuka Langley Soryu.
I’m very pleased to meet you.
Deploying for large scale\Nshoreline interception...
...Asuka and Shinji’s first close\Nteamwork results in their being\Nroughed up due to their bad terms.
Misato gets a plan to achieve\Ntheir perfect unison.
A six-day-long drama for human\Ndestiny shall begin.
The next episode:\N“With One Accord in a Flash.”
Well, we’ll make you a bargain!
Like an angel that has no\Nsense of mercy...
Rise, young boy, to the heavens\Nlike a legend.
Cold winds, as blue as the sea,
Tear open the door to\Nyour heart, I see.
But unknowing you seem, just\Nstaring at me...
Standing there smiling serenely.
Desperate, for something to touch...
A moment of kindness like\Nthat in a dream.
Your innocent eyes, have yet no idea...
Of the path your destiny will follow.
But someday you’ll become aware of...
Everything that you’ve got behind you.
Your wings are for seeking out a new...
Future that only you can search for.
The cruel angel’s thesis enters through\Nthe window of your soul.
If you should betray the chapel\Nof your memories.
The cruel angel’s thesis bleeds through\Na portal like your pulsing blood.
So, boy, stand tall and embrace\Nthe fire of the legend,
Embracing the universe like\Na blazing star!
Hey, have you seen her yet?
Oh, yeah!  Yeah!
Seen what?
You dork, you haven’t seen the girl\Nwho studied overseas yet?
Girl who studied overseas?
Yeah, she’s in 8th grade, Class A.
She just transferred here last week.
She’s hot!
Her name’s Asuka Langley Soryu,\Ndid you know that?
Yeah, she’s so cute.
Since she was raised over there but\Nborn here, do you think she\Nalready has a boyfriend?
Don’t be stupid!
I bet she broke up in Germany,\Nand she’s here in a foreign land...
...with a heart that can’t be mended.
Oh, my gosh...
...did you hear all the cat talk?
Asuka!  Asuka!
They’re just ignorant.
Thank you, come again.
At least the pictures don’t\Nreveal her personality.
Hello!
Shinji!
Guten Morgen!
G...guten Morgen.
Why so gloomy?  This is the gorgeous\NAsuka greeting you!
You should appreciate\Nyour good fortune!
I’m the most popular girl in school!
Hey, the other one’s here too, isn’t she?
Other one?
What are you, stupid?  I’m talking\Nabout the First Child, of course!
Oh, Ayanami...
Hello!
You must be Rei Ayanami, the pilot\Nof the prototype.
I’m Asuka!  Asuka Langley Soryu.
I’m the designated pilot of Eva Unit 02.\NLet’s be good friends!
Why?
Because it’d be convenient.\NYou know what I mean?
If I’m ordered to, I will.
Talk about odd...
I’ll say.  Are only weirdos\Nchosen to be pilots?
You’ve lost some weight.
Is that so?
You must be enduring\Nan unrequited love.
How... did you know?
Because...
...“a woman with a mole in the\Npathway of her tears is destined\Nto a life full of them.”
If you’re trying to put a move\Non me, I’m afraid you can’t.
There’s a very ugly face observing us.
Long time no see, Mr. Kaji.
It’s been a while.
You’re a little less discreet\Nthan I expected.
He hasn’t ever been discreet in his life!
You’ve finished handing over Unit 02,\Nhaven’t you?!  You should\Nbe leaving now!
I just received orders this morning\Nthat I’ll be staying here “on loan.”
So, we can hang around again...
...just like we used to.
You’ve got to be kidding!
Enemy attack?!
We just got this report from the\Nbattle cruiser Haruna.
“Have detected huge submerged object\Noff Kii peninsula.  Sending data.”
The data has been collated\Nand examined.
Wavelength Pattern Blue.\NConfirmed to be an Angel.
All personnel, go to first stage alert.
The recent battle severely damaged\NTokyo-3’s intercept system.
Only 26% of our defense capability\Nhas been restored.
In addition, our operational capability\Nfor actual combat is virtually nil.
Therefore, we’re going to have to\Nintercept the target at the water’s edge,\Nright before it makes landfall!
Units 01 and 02 will mount a\Ncoordinated attack in a series of waves.
In other words, close in and take turns.
Roger.
This sucks.  My Japanese debut and\Nshe won’t let me handle it solo.
Why do I have to bring you?!
SOP.  Procedures, you know.
Well, let me tell you something, just\Ndon’t get in my way!
His selection as a pilot must have\Nbeen a joke, right?
Two against one is not what I call\Na fair fight.  It’s not fair.
We don’t get a choice.
Survival takes priority.
There!
Commence attack!
I’ll handle this Angel!  You cover me!
C...cover you?!
Ladies first!
Damn it, don’t give me orders\Nyou dumb rookie!
Charge!
That wasn’t bad.
Well, Third Child, what did you\Nthink of that?
A fight should be clean and\Nelegant, without waste.
What’s this crap?!
Today, at 10:58.15 AM...
...Unit 01 was attacked\Nby Target Alpha...
...which had separated from the other\Ntarget submerged 2 km off Suruga Bay.
At the same hour, same minute, plus 20\Nseconds, Unit 02 was halted by\NTarget Beta’s attack.
We have a comment from\NProject E chairperson.
This is pathetic.
This is all your fault!  You totally\Nscrewed up my debut battle!
What are you talking about?  You’re\Nthe one who charged in there acting\Nlike an idiot!
Idiot?!  How dare you call me that?\NYou pathetic excuse for a combat pilot!
You’re just a jerk!
Look in the mirror!  You were in such a\Nrush to show off in combat that you\Ncompletely disregarded procedures!
What was that?  You look\Nlike a drowned rat!
You... you can’t say that\Nkind of thing to me!
...operation and transferred command\Nto the UN Secondary Force.
We’ve been humiliated.
At 11:05 AM, the UN forces made\Nan attack with an N2 mine.
We’ll have to redraw the map again.
They succeeded in burning off 28% of\Ntarget’s structural substance.
Did they kill it?
This is merely temporary relief.  The\Nsecond attack is just a matter of time.
At least we have time to reorganize\Nand regroup.  You can’t ask for\Nmore than that.
Listen up, you two.
Do you know what your job is?
Piloting Eva.
No!
Your job is to defeat the Angels.
NERV does not exist to make grotesque\Ndisplays like this.
Therefore, you two must cooperate.
Why should we?!
Enough already!
Why does everyone get so angry here?
It’s because adults are much too\Naware of their credibility.
Um, where’s Misato?
Clearing things up.  The person in\Ncharge exists to take responsibility.
Here are the protests and damage\Nreports from the bureau concerned.
This is a bill from the UN...
...and here you have a complaint from\Nthe Public Relations Department as well.
Read them all.
I can tell what they say without looking.
“If you’re going to fight,\Ndo it here,” right?
Good guess.
I’ll do it as soon as we take\Ncare of this Angel.
I swear I will destroy that Angel.
The Vice-Commander is pretty angry.
You’ll almost certainly be demoted\Nif you embarrass him again.
It was just good luck within bad luck\Nthat Commander Ikari wasn’t here.
If he’d been here, you’d have been fired\Nbefore he ever saw these papers.
So, have you brought me an\Nidea to help save my job?
Just one.
I thank you, Dr. Ritsuko Akagi.
It’s good to have a friend\None can count on.
However, I’m not the one who’ll\Nbe saving my old friend.
This is Kaji’s idea.
Kaji?
I’m home!  Not that anyone’s here,\Nof course, but...
What is this?!
Don’t be so rude!
Those are my personal belongings!
You!  What in blazes are you\Ndoing in my house?!
Why are you STILL here?
Still here?
Yeah, you’ve been dumped\Nfor the new model!
Misato will be living with me.
Of course, that’s a much more logical\Nchoice when you consider\Nmy superior abilities.
Although honestly, I’d rather\Nlive with Kaji.
Say, just why are Japanese houses\Nso small anyway?
Not even half of my stuff fits!
And Japanese sure don’t have\Nany sense of privacy.
How can they live in a room without\Nlocks?  Unbelievable!
It’s because the Japanese way is to\Nconsider the priorities and needs of\Nothers before one’s own.
Misato!
How are you?  You two are going\Nto get along real well, right?
What do you mean?
This is all preparation for\Nthe next operation.
Say what?
There is only one way to destroy\Nthe Seventh Angel!
A simultaneous two-point attack\Non each target’s core while its\Ncomponents are separated.
In other words, an attack by two Evas\Nwith perfectly synchronized timing.
Cooperation and coordination between\Nthe two of you will be paramount.
Therefore, I want the two\Nof you to live together.
No way!  “A boy and a girl should\Nnever sleep under one roof after\Nthe age of seven”!
The Angel is currently restoring itself.
It will begin its second assault\Nin six days, there’s no time.
But it’s impossible.
Now we have a way to\Nmake it possible!
The master attack pattern will be\Nchoreographed using this music.
In six days, as soon as possible.
I’m worried about Shinji.
He’s been gone three days, right?
Hey, there’s the class rep.
Two of the three stooges.
Why are you here?
To offer condolences to Miss Soryu.\NWhat about you two?
To offer condolences to Ikari.
Why did you stop here?
Yes?
Y...you’ve betrayed us.
You look like two peas in a pod.
I can’t believe this!
Neither can we.  It’s all Misato’s fault!\NWe have to eat, breathe and\Nsleep together!
You’re living in sin!  How awful!
No!  It’s not like that!
Then just what is it like?
Hi, welcome everybody!
Why don’t you explain all this to us?
You should have told us that first.
How is the coordination coming?
Well, as you can see.
Well, so much for synchronization!
I could never sink down to the pathetic\Nlevel this animated turnip lives at!
If you ask me, this whole\Nidea is impossible!
Then you give up?
But you don’t have anyone\Nelse, do you?
Rei...
Yes, ma’am.
Why don’t you try?
Yes, ma’am.
It looks like I should alter the operation\Nto make a pair of Shinji and Rei.
No!  I can’t stand this!
I can’t take it anymore!
Asuka!
Even the Devil cries sometimes.
Ikari!
You’ve got to follow her!
You made her cry!  It’s your fault!
Well...
Don’t say anything.
I know.
I have to pilot the Eva.
I’ve got no choice.
I’ll do it.
No matter what, I’ll put Rei and\NMisato to shame!
You don’t have to squash them.
You’re being too simplistic, even if\Nyou are a man!
I must avenge myself...
...my pride...
It’s a matter of honor now, you see?
Where’s Misato?
At work.  She called earlier.\NShe’ll be there all night.
So, that means we’re all\Nalone tonight, huh?
This is the impenetrable “Wall\Nof Jericho,” Third Child.
Take one step over this wall\Nand you’ll be a dead man.
And now, it’s time to go to bed, children!
Why do Japanese sleep on the floor?\NThis is so stupid.
Mama...
Mama...
You’re just a child yourself.
No, somebody’s watching us.
Who’s watching?
Someb...
No!  There’s nothing between\Nus anymore.
Don’t do that again.
But your lips didn’t say no.
Which one should I trust?
Your lips or your words?
There you go.
Thanks.
You’re unusually sober today.
Yeah, a little...
Work?  Or a man?
A lot of things.
Still in love?
Don’t be ridiculous!!
Who’d want that idiot?!
I was young, and it’s still the biggest\Nblemish on my whole life.
I meant that he may still like you.\NDid I scare you?
Why you lousy...
You’re only proving my hypothesis.
Why don’t you go with your feelings?
It’s not like it’s still eight years ago.
It hasn’t changed.  Not a bit.\NHe’s still immature.
Well, I’ve got to get to work.\NTomorrow is D-Day.
Target has broken through the\Nfinal defense line at Gora.
Here it comes!
We won’t fail this time!
Spread your AT fields as soon\Nas the music starts.
Then follow the operation\Nchoreography.
Are you two ready?
Roger!
The target has entered the mountains.
Just remember Shinji, full power,\Nmaximum performance.
I know that.  We’ll finish in 62 seconds.
Target entering ground zero.
Detach external power cables.
Launch.
Confirmation.  Both Evas are\Noperational.
Jeez...
This is pathetic.
You jerk!
What are you doing on my Unit 02?!
What are you talking about?  You’re\Nthe one who fell on me!
You’re the one who lost\Nhis timing first!
You’re always so slow!
What were you doing, staying up so\Nlate last night?!
Image training for today’s battle!
Liar!  I know you tried to kiss\Nme while I was sleeping!
You cheat!  You were awake?
Oh, my gosh!  I was just kidding!\NDid you really kiss me?!
No, I didn’t!  I stopped!
Pervert!  Fiend!  Idiot!\NI can’t believe this!
You caused it by calling for your\Nmother and sleepwalking!
Those kids are embarrassing us again.
The crater of Mt. Asama where an\Nunhatched Angel lies.
Misato immediately requests the\Nannouncement of an A-17.
NERV personnel attempt the first\Ncapture of an Angel under top\Npriority circumstances.
An Eva with limited area equipment\Nchallenges the fires of hell!
It’s an extreme environment of\Nhigh heat and pressure.
What did Asuka see there?
It’s the next episode, “Magma Diver.”
And I’ll give you more service!

Lucky!
I’m so lucky that I can go\Nshopping with you today, Kaji!
What the?!  Isn’t this the\Nswimsuit section?
This is what’s in fashion these days.
Oh, really?
I’m so anxious about this school trip.\NI just know we’ll have a great time.
And where are you going for the trip?
O-ki-na-wa.
We’re even scheduled to go\Nscuba diving!
Scuba diving...
It’s been three years since\NI’ve gone diving.
Say, where did you go for\Nyour school trip?
Well, we didn’t have one.
Why not?
Because of the Second Impact.
Whaaaat?!
I can’t go on the trip?!
Right.
Why not?!
Because you’re on standby\Nfor combat duty.
You never told me anything about that!
I just told you.
Who in the hell decided that?!!
Me, the Operations Planning Manager.
Hey, you!  Why don’t you stop slurping\Nthat tea and say something to her?
Be a man!
Actually, I kind of anticipated it\Nwould be like this.
And you’ve already given up?
Talk about pathetic.  There’s nothing\Nmore useless than a housebroken male.
Please don’t talk about me like that.
I know how you must feel...
...but there’s no other way.
There’s always the possibility that an\NAngel may attack while you’re away.
It’s always “standby”!\NStandby, standby, standby!
We’ve always got to be ready to\Ndefend against an enemy who may\Nor may not be coming!
Why don’t you try to find out where\Nthey are and attack them first?!
If we could do that we’d\Nhave already done it.
Look, think of this as an opportunity\Nto catch up.
While the rest of your class\Nis on the trip...
...the two of you can study.
Or do you think I don’t know\Nabout these?
If you thought I wouldn’t know about\Nyour test scores unless you told me...
...you made a big mistake.  Finding out\Nwhat your grades are...
...is quite simple for me.
It’s ridiculous.  This school’s grades\Nare meaningless!
The old-fashioned numeric grading\Nscale system you use on your\Nexams means nothing to me.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
You could at least try to adjust to\NJapanese school life.
Noooooooo way!
Asuka, I’ll bring you some souvenirs!
Well, it’s just too bad for you guys!
Don’t feel bad, I’ll have enough\Nfun for both of you!
Post the survey data on Mt. Asama\Nfrom Balthasar to Melchior\Nas soon as possible.
A school trip?
That’s pretty casual behavior for\Ntimes like these.
Well, it’s because the times are so\Nhard that they want to have a little\Nfun while they can.
What are you up to?
Studying physics.
You’re such an obedient\Nstudent, Mr. Big Shot.
Well, I’d have to anyway.
Ta-da!
Since I can’t go scuba diving in\NOkinawa, I’m going to do it here!
Really?
What’re you working on?
Lemme see.
You can’t solve an easy\Nproblem like this?
There!  Here you go!
It’s so easy.
How can you solve a difficult problem\Nlike this and not make good grades\Non your tests?
Because I couldn’t figure out\Nwhat the questions said.
You mean you couldn’t read the\Nquestions in Japanese?
Right, I haven’t learned all\Nof the Kanji yet.
I didn’t have to study it in college.
College?
Yeah, I graduated last year.
What does this one say?
It’s about thermal expansion.
Thermal expansion?  Kid stuff.
To put it simply, things expand when\Nthey get hot and shrink when\Nthey get cold.
Well, it sounds easy enough in theory...
So, if I were to warm up my bust, do\Nyou think they’d grow bigger?
How would I know such a thing?!
You’re such a boring little boy.
Looky, looky, Shinji!
Back Roll Entry!
This just isn’t clear enough.
But the report from the Mt. Asama\NEarthquake Research Lab\Nwould indicate...
...that we should take a closer look\Nat this shadow.
Of course, we can’t ignore this.
What’s MAGI’s judgment?
Fifty-fifty.
Is someone there yet?
Captain Katsuragi’s already on site.
You’ve gone too deep.
Not yet, descend another 500, please.
Depth 1200.  The pressure resistant\Npartition is cracking.
Ms. Katsuragi!!
If it breaks, we’ll pay for the damage.\N200 more, please.
We’re monitoring a reaction!!
Begin analysis!
Right!
The probe has imploded due to\Nthe extreme pressure.
Did you get a result?
Just barely.
The pattern is blue.
Then there’s no doubt.
It’s an Angel.
From this point forward, this laboratory\Nwill be completely sealed off.
It’s under NERV’s jurisdiction now!
Any and all access to the outside\Nworld is prohibited.
All records pertaining to the events of\Nthe past six hours are classified.
I need an A-17 from Commander Ikari,\Ntop priority!
Watch what you’re saying.
This is an open line.
I know.
Switch me to a scrambled line.
A-17?!
An offensive attack?
Correct.
Unacceptable, it’s too dangerous!
Have you forgotten what happened\Nfifteen years ago?
This is our chance to move from a\Nperpetually defensive posture to\Nan offensive one.
The risk is enormous.
However, I’m sure you’re aware how\Nimportant it is to obtain a living Angel\Nas a sample, aren’t you?
We will not tolerate failure.
Failure?
If we fail, it will result in the extinction\Nof the entire human race.
Are you really going to do it?
This is an Angel?
Yes, it’s something like a chrysalis\Nprior to reaching the adult stage.
This operation’s prime objective is to\Ncapture this Angel.
We must capture it alive and in\Na form as close to its original\Nstate as possible.
And if we fail?
Then you must destroy it immediately.\NDo you understand?
Roger!
The designated pilot for the\Nactual operation is...
Hey, let me!  I dive!
...Asuka!
You will carry out the mission\Nusing Unit 02.
Sure!  It’ll be easy.
And me?
The special equipment we’ll be using\Nisn’t standardized for use on\Nthe Unit 00 prototype.
Rei and Unit 00 will remain at\Nheadquarters on standby.
Yes.
Oh, too bad.
You don’t get to go to the hot springs.
Now that an A-17 has been ordered,\Nwe must scramble immediately.
Get ready.
Roger!
This heat-resistant plug suit doesn’t\Nseem any different from our\Nregular ones.
Press the switch on your right wrist.
Oh, no!
What is this?
Unit 02 is also ready.
No!
I don’t believe this!
That suit’s designed to protect you from\Nheat, pressure and nuclear radiation.
This is Type-D equipment, for combat\Nunder extreme environmental duress.
Is that my Unit 02?
No way!  I quit!!
I don’t want to appear in public\Nin this dorky outfit!
This is the sort of thing Shinji’s for!
I’m so disappointed.
I was anticipating seeing Asuka’s\Ngallant figure!
No!
I can’t let Mr. Kaji see me in\Nthis awful looking thing.
We’re having problems?
Well, yes.
Excuse me, but I can.
I’ll go in Unit 02.
No, I don’t want you touching\Nmy Unit 02!
I’d rather do it than let her\Ntake my place.
I’m sorry about the look.\NPlease, forgive me.
Eva Units 01 and 02 have arrived.
Have both units stand by in position.
Move in the laser bore and\Nready the crane.
Roger.
Hey, isn’t Kaji here yet?
That male buffoon won’t be coming.\NHe’s got no business here.
Oh, damn!  I wanted him to\Nsee how great I am.
An A-17 has been ordered.
That includes the freeze of\Nall current assets.
I assume that means that some people\Nwill be getting into a bit of trouble.
Why didn’t you stop them?
I had no excuse for stopping it.
This order is an official one.
But, surely you must know that if NERV\Nfails, the whole world will perish.
They’re not that arrogant.
What are... those?
The UN and the Air Force will be\Non standby alert...
...until this mission has been completed.
Will they help us?
No, they’re here to clean up...
...in case we fail.
What do you mean?
They will employ N2 depth charges\Nto destroy the Angel and us with it.
That’s dreadful!
Who would order something like that?
Commander Ikari.
Laser operation, complete.
The bore path has been secured.
The Type D equipment is\Nfunctioning normally.
Unit 02 is in position to dispatch.
Roger.
Asuka, are you ready?
Anytime you are.
Launch.
It looks hot!
Unit 02 is entering the lava.
Look at this, Shinji!
Giant Stroke Entry!
Current depth: 170.
Speed of descent: 20.
No problems detected.
Visibility is zero.
I can’t see a thing.
Switching to CT monitor.
Even with this, the range of clarity is\Nno more than 120.
Depth is 400...
450...
500...
550...
600...
650...
900...
950...
1000...
1020...
We’re over the maximum safety depth.
Depth is 1300.
Unit 02 has reached estimated\Ntarget level.
Asuka?
Can you see anything?
No reactions detected.  It’s not here.
The lava circulation is faster\Nthan we thought.
The target’s velocity doesn’t\Nmatch our predictions.
Hurry up and recalculate.
Continue the operation.\NMaintain descent.
Depth is 1350.
1400...
A crack has occurred on the\Nsecond coolant pipe.
Depth is 1480.
We have exceeded the maximum\Nallowed depth.
It hasn’t made contact with\Nthe target, yet.
Go on.
How’s it going, Asuka?
I’m okay.  I just want to finish this and\Ntake a shower, as soon as possible.
There’s a nice hot spring near here.\NWe’ll hit it once this is finished.
Just hang in there a little longer.
Maximum allowed depth plus 120.
Eva Unit 02 has lost its\Nprogressive knife.
Maximum allowed depth plus 200.
Captain Katsuragi, we’ve got to stop!
Have you forgotten that there’s a\Nhuman being in there?
I am in charge of this operation.
Proceed, please.
Misato’s right.
I’m okay.  I can go on.
Depth 1780.
Unit 02 has reached the corrected\Ntarget depth.
There it is!
Target in sight.
Prepare to capture.
All right, due to the motion of the\Nconvection current moving you\Nand the target...
...you’ll have just one chance\Nto make contact.
I know.  Just leave it to me.
30 to contact.
Relative velocity 2.2.  On the axis.
The electromagnetic cage has been\Nspread.  No problems detected.
The target has been captured.
Nice, Asuka.
Operation completed.
I’m coming up now.
Are you all right, Asuka?
Who do you think you’re talking to?\NFear is often worse than danger itself.
It was an easy assignment.
Boy, this isn’t a plug suit.\NIt’s a sauna suit!
I wanna take a bath.
The tension let loose all at once.
Yeah?
You were scared about this operation\Ntoo, weren’t you?
Well, yeah.  Because if it’d gone wrong,\Nit could’ve caused another disaster.
Right, Second Impact.
Nobody would want to\Nrepeat that again.
What’s going on?!
Oh, no!  It’s started to hatch!
It’s much earlier than we predicted!
Status of the cage?!
There’s no way it can withstand this!
Abort the capture!  Jettison the cage!
We’re changing the operation!
Destroying the Angel is\Nnow top priority!
Unit 02, withdraw and\Nprepare for combat!
This is what I’ve waited for!
Damn it!  I forgot I dropped the knife!
It’s right in front of me!
Releasing ballast!!
It’s fast!
This is no good.  I’ve lost it.
In addition to that, I’ve got lousy\Nvisibility, I’m too hot...
...and this disgusting suit’s stuck to my\Nbody with sweat.
This really sucks.
Asuka!
We’ll drop you Unit 01’s knife.
Catch it!
Roger!
Oh, no!!
Have you dropped it, Shinji?
Contact with knife, 40 seconds.
The Angel is approaching rapidly!
No!  Go away!
Hurry up!  Come on!
What the hell?!?
Unbelievable!  How can it open its\Nmouth in such an environment?
Its construction must be incredible!
The left leg is damaged!
The heat shields!!
Damn you!!
If this thing can withstand such a\Nhigh-heat, high-pressure environment...
...then the progressive knife will\Nbe useless against it!
Then what’s the solution?
I know!!
Like the one earlier!!
Eat this!!
I understand!  Thermal expansion!!
Transfer all coolant pressure to\Ncable three!!  Hurry!!
I’ve done it but...
Is this the end?  Looks like that’s that.
Shinji?
Idiot!  What a show off!
Hello?
Are the NERV personnel here?
Yes!
I need your signature here.
Thanks so much.
From Mr. Kaji?
What is this?
The bath’s over there, to the left.
This feels like heaven.
Shinji, can you hear me?
Y...yes, ma’am!
Would you throw me the\Nbody shampoo?
We ran out of ours.
Sure.
Here it comes.
Roger.
Ouch!
You idiot!  You dork, watch where\Nyou’re throwing!
S...sorry.
He hit me in my most essential part!
Let me take a look.
Wow, your skin is so soft\Nand smooth, Asuka!
Don’t!  You’re tickling me!
How about right here?
Wow!  Don’t touch that!
Come on, what gives?
Oh, this?  I got this in\Nthe Second Impact.
You know all about my past, don’t you?
Well, yeah.  It’s a part of my job.
It’s all ancient history now.
We should just forget.
The Angels aren’t Commander Ikari’s\Nonly enemies.
When those who are displeased with\NNERV cut off Tokyo-3’s power supply...
...an Angel arrives at NERV\NHeadquarters to find it\Ncompletely locked up...
...with no modernized\Nfacilities operational.
Can three kids wandering through the\Nunderground labyrinth...
...make it to headquarters in time to\Nintercept the Angel?
It’s the next episode,\N“In the Still Darkness.”
You can expect more service\Nnext time too!
Like an angel that has no\Nsense of mercy...
Rise, young boy, to the heavens\Nlike a legend.
Cold winds, as blue as the sea,
Tear open the door to\Nyour heart, I see.
But unknowing you seem, just\Nstaring at me...
Standing there smiling serenely.
Desperate, for something to touch...
A moment of kindness like\Nthat in a dream.
Your innocent eyes, have yet no idea...
Of the path your destiny will follow.
But someday you’ll become aware of...
Everything that you’ve got behind you.
Your wings are for seeking out a new...
Future that only you can search for.
The cruel angel’s thesis enters through\Nthe window of your soul.
If you should betray the chapel\Nof your memories.
The cruel angel’s thesis bleeds through\Na portal like your pulsing blood.
So, boy, stand tall and embrace\Nthe fire of the legend,
Embracing the universe like\Na blazing star!
Cool!  I won a free ice cream bar!
Boy, the cost of doing laundry has\Nbeen killing me lately.
I just wish I had the time to wash\Nmy clothes for myself.
You should appreciate the fact that\Nyou can at least sleep at home.
Hello, Vice-Commander.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning, sir!
Good morning.
You’re quite early today.
Well, I have to go uptown as\NIkari’s representative.
I see, isn’t today the City Council’s\Nregular meeting?
It’s a boring job.
He always forces the most\Ntedious work on me.
Without the MAGI’s help,\NI couldn’t do it.
Speaking of which, election day\Nis coming up, isn’t it?
The City Council has no\Nauthority at all.
Actually, the MAGI run\Neverything now.
The MAGI?
You mean the three\Nsupercomputers?
Government by the majority decision\Nof three different computers.
It’s a sort of democratic system.
And the council just obeys\Ntheir decisions?
It’s a most effective form\Nof government.
This truly is a “city of science.”
We are fortunate to live in an\Nera when Almighty Science\Nreigns supreme.
Talk about old fashioned viewpoints.
Come to think of it, you have\Nan experiment to run on\NUnit 00, don’t you?
Yes, we’re going to perform\Nthe second prolonged activation\Ntest at 10:30.
I’m expecting good news.
Abort experiment!  Cut the circuit!
Switching circuits.
Power supply restored.
This component is the\Nproblem again.
Yes.
I think the problem is the conversion\Nefficiency is 0.008 lower than our\Ntheoretical calculations.
It’s within the tolerance\Nthough, barely.
What are we going to do?
Let’s try it again using the\Nsame configuration...
...but lower the reciprocal\Nconversion rate by 0.01.
Roger.
Now, let’s recommence the\Nreactivation experiment.
Hey, hold up!
Shit...
Man, I’ve never had to\Nrun this much!
So what’s with the black expression?
It’s from having to see your\Nloathsome face first thing\Nin the morning.
Yes, hold just a moment please.
What?
Well, Father...
What?  Hurry up.
Well...
I’m supposed to...
...tell my parent that an interview...
...for Advanced Vocational\NEducation is going to be\Nheld at school...
I’ve delegated things like\Nthat to Captain Katsuragi.
Don’t bother me with such nonsense.
Don’t forward any more\Nof these calls to—
What?
A blackout?
No, it can’t be.  It’s not possible.
Something’s strange.  An accident?
Perhaps Dr. Akagi made a mistake?
The main power supply has\Nbeen interrupted.
Voltage level is zero!
It’s not my fault!
What do you think?
It’ll switch to the backup\Npower supply soon.
No, the backup circuits\Naren’t working.
That can’t be.
Which circuits are functioning?
Only 1.2% of them!\NOnly nine circuits out of 2,567!
Route all of the remaining power\Ncircuits to maintain the MAGI\Nand Central Dogma.
But that could interfere with\Nlife support systems.
Do it!  That’s our top priority!
This is Nozomu Takahashi, who\Nwants a more cheerful government.
Thank you!
Maybe Commander Ikari was\Njust really busy?
I doubt it.
It wasn’t like he hung up.  It was\Nmore like a mechanical failure.
Hey, are you a man or what?
Stop letting every little\Nincident bother you!
What?
What do you think you’re doing?\NHere, let me try that!
Damn!!  It must be broken, damn it!
Heave...
...ho!
We’d better head for the\Ncommand station.
It’s been seven minutes and the\Npower hasn’t restored itself.  This is...
...very unusual.
What’s the backup\Npower system here?
There are three circuits,\Nmain, sub and reserve.
It’s virtually impossible for all\Nof those to fail at once.
Then that means...
...the circuit breakers didn’t go on\Ntheir own.  Someone must have\Nblown them intentionally.
Regardless of the cause, it would be\Ndisastrous if an Angel were to\Nattack right now.
Radar has detected an\Nunidentified object.
Projected landing point is in\Nthe former Atami region.
It must be number eight.
I agree, it must be an Angel.
What are we going to do?
Go to alert status.  That’s the\Nprocedure, anyway.
This one’s destination\Nhas to be Tokyo-3.
I agree.  Well, this is no job for us.
The Angel has landed.
It’s still advancing.
What about Tokyo-3?
It’s still silent.
What in the hell are those\NNERV guys doing?
I never thought I’d actually have to\Nuse one of these trap exits.
I thought they were just holdovers\Nfrom an outdated technology that\Nwe kept for our peace of mind.
“To provide is to prevent.”
This one doesn’t work either!
None of the facilities work.\NThis is odd.
Could this mean that something’s\Nhappened down in the Geo-Front?
It is natural to assume that.
In any case, let’s try to make contact\Nwith NERV Headquarters.
No, the emergency phones aren’t\Ngetting through either.
No, there’s no answer on Line 77.
No, no response.
Not on this one either.\NSo, the main and emergency\Ncables are both down.
What do we do now?
What’re you doing?
What are you, stupid?  I’m looking\Nfor my emergency manual.
Anyway, let’s go to\NNERV Headquarters.
Yeah, but before that we’ll need\Nto decide who will be the\Nleader of this group.
And naturally, I am the leader.
Any objections?
Now, let’s go.
We can proceed along\NRoute-07, right here.
But the doors don’t work.
We can open it manually.
There you go, Shinji, that’s your job.
I don’t believe it!  You always\Nwant to control everything...
...but you always defer to me\Nin a situation like this.
Damn those Joint Staff Council\Nbastards!  They always defer\Nto us in a situation like this!
What does the government say?
Those Tokyo-2 buttheads?\NThey’re getting ready to run.
The Angel is still advancing.
In any case, we must contact NERV.
But how?
By going there yourself.
This is the 3rd District ASDF!
An unidentified object is moving\Ntoward this area.
All residents must evacuate to\Ntheir designated shelters!
Big trouble!
I’ve got to report this\Nto headquarters!
But how?
Remember Takahashi, who remains\Ncalm even in situations\Nsuch as this!
Please support candidate Takahashi!
Lucky!
It’s too hot.
Yeah, the air conditioners are out.
Katsuragi...
If you’re so hot, why don’t you\Ntake off your shirt?
There’s no reason for shyness\Nbetween you and me.
Don’t even think about trying to\Ntake advantage of this situation.
Okay, okay!
It’s getting even worse.\NNow, the air is getting stagnant.
It’s hard to believe that this facility\Nrepresents the most advanced\Ntechnology on Earth.
But look at the Commander\Nand Vice-Commander.
Even in this much heat,\Nthey’re cool and in command.
It’s getting warmer.
Yes...
...along with the declaration of\Nemergency in this district.
Emergency vehicle!\NPassing through!
Oh, my!  Excuse me, it’s blocked!
It’s okay!  Charge!
This is an emergency!\NEverything is permitted!
Aye, sir!
No!  Let me off!!
This Geo-Front was designed\Nto be a self-sufficient colony, even\Nwhen isolated from the outside.
Theoretically, it’s impossible for all\Nof the power sources to be shut\Ndown at once.
You mean that someone\Ncaused it to happen?
Their purpose would be\Nto map this facility.
You mean they could determine\Nour headquarters’ structure by\Nanalyzing the restoration process?
Disrespectful bastards.
I’ll run a dummy program\Nthrough the MAGI.
That will make it harder for them\Nto get a complete picture\Nof the structure.
I’ll leave it to you, then.
I can’t believe the first havoc\Nwreaked upon our headquarters...
...wasn’t caused by some Angel,\Nbut by another member of\Nour own species.
One of mankind’s greatest enemies\Nis man himself.
But it usually only takes\Ntwo minutes.
Are you sure this is the right way?
Of course I’m sure!  If we can\Nget beyond this point we’ll\Nbe at the Geo-Front.
Haven’t I heard that four\Ntimes already?
You’re too picky.  You’re always\Nfocusing on the most insubstantial\Nlittle tidbits.
Silence, please.
What now, Wonder Girl?
A man’s voice.
Ang...  ...proaching...
That’s Hyuga!
Hey!!  Hey!!  Hey!!
An Angel is approaching!\NRepeat, an Angel is approaching!
An Angel?!
We can’t waste any more time.
Let’s take a shortcut.
Hey, I’m the leader!  Don’t take any\Ninitiatives without my permission!
Now then, where is this shortcut?
This may be the quickest way,\Nbut we look really stupid.
Say, just what do you think\Nthe Angels are?
Why are you talking about\Nsomething like that at a\Ntime like this?
Well, angels are messengers of God,\Nright?  But our enemies are\Nnamed after angels.
So, why are we fighting them?
What are you, stupid?\NStrange beings started attacking us.
When someone’s attacking you,\Nyou can’t just sit there and do\Nnothing, right?
To the right!
I think the correct path is to the left.
Stop bothering me!
What do you think, Shinji?
Well...
I’m not sure.
Damn it!  I’m the leader, so just\Nshut up and follow me!!
You know, I kind of expected that\Nthis would be a little odd.\NThe path is going up.
What do you mean “you expected”?\NYou’re always nit-picking\Nand worrying!
Look, this has got to be it this time!
Well, we’ve visually confirmed\Nthe Angel’s presence!
Now, we know we have to hurry.
An Angel is approaching!\NAn immediate Eva dispatch will\Nbe necessary!
Oh, my gosh!
Fuyutsuki, take care of\Nthe rest of this.
Ikari?
I will help prepare for the\Nlaunch in the cage.
Are you serious?
You mean by hand?
We have a diesel generator\Nfor such emergencies.
But...
We have no pilots!
Not again!
This way.
I’ve heard that you’re the\NCommander’s favorite, aren’t you?
You’re a favored smart ass who’s\Ntreated differently from the rest of us.
Stop it!  This isn’t the time for that!
You’ve always got that smug\Nlook on your face.
Hey, do you think you can\Nact superior just because\Nyou’re treated better?
I don’t act superior.
And I’m not treated better either.
I know that quite well.
Roger.  The ejection of the\Ntermination plug is complete.
Good, prepare to insert\Nthe entry plug.
But the pilots aren’t here yet.
Don’t worry, they’ll come.
There’s no way I can open\Nthis with my hands.
It can’t be helped.  We’ll have to\Nbreak into a duct to get through.
This First Child isn’t someone to\Nmess with.  She’ll do anything to\Naccomplish her objectives.
She’s a real self-righteous bitch.
The plug is fixed and ready.
Now, we just have to\Nwait for the kids.
If you dare look forward...
...I’ll kill you!!
You jerk!
Ignoramus!  Nincompoop!
I told you not to look!
I have to see to go forward...
Ah, there you are.
Prepare for entry!
Roger, open the hatches manually.
How are the Evas?
They’re in standby.
How?  Nothing’s working.
It was all done by hand.
It was the Commander’s idea.
My father’s?
Commander Ikari believed in you,\NShinji, and prepared everything.
Plugs inserted.
All units activated using backup\Npower supply.
Remove primary lockbolts.
Hydraulic locks numbers 2\Nthrough 32, released.
Zero pressure.
The situation is free.
Go ahead and remove the restraints.
Begin the attack!
The target has stopped\Nright above us.
Get ready!  Hurry up!
The emergency batteries\Nhave been installed!
Well, we’re ready.
Launch!!
Jeez!  I look so pathetic!
We’re approaching a vertical shaft.
This is still pathetic.
Watch out!  Dodge!
No!
It would appear the target is going to\Ninvade headquarters directly using\Nthat liquid solvent.
What’ll we do?
We’re going to beat it, of course.
Sure, but how?
We dropped our rifles and the\Nbattery packs on our backs\Nare running out.
They won’t last more than\Nanother three minutes.
I have a plan.
One of us will take the defensive\Nposition and stay here.
Their job is to neutralize\Nthe Angel’s AT Field...
...and to protect the offensive\Nplayer from that acid.
The backup player...
...will go down, pick up the rifles and\Nhand them to the offense.
The offense will then fire a volley\Nto destroy the target.
How does that sound?
I see, I will take the defense.
Sorry, but it’s not you.
It’s me.
It’s too dangerous!
That’s why.
I’ll feel bad if I don’t pay you back\Nfor the one I owe you from\Nthe last battle.
Shinji will be the offense.\NWonder Girl is the backup.
Got it?
Understood.
Here we go!
CHARGE!!
Ayanami!!
Asuka, get out of the way!!
Now we’re even.
Oh, damn it!!  Why doesn’t it open?!
This is a desperate situation!  I’ve got\Nto go to the bathroom now!
Hey, I told you not to look up!
Okay!  Yes, ma’am!
Disgusting...
It’s ironic...
Without electricity and artificial\Nlight, the sky can look so beautiful.
But without the lights, it’s as if\Nthere were no humans there.
See?  I feel much more\Ncomfortable this way.
Man has always feared the darkness,\Nso he scrapes away at its edges\Nwith fire.
He creates life by diminishing\Nthe darkness.
A philosopher.
Is that what makes mankind\Na special species?
Is that why the Angels keep\Nattacking us?
What are you, stupid?
Who knows what they think?
Misato’s achievements are evaluated\Nand she is promoted to Major.
However, her whole career has\Nmerely been a result of her personal\Ndrive to exterminate the Angels.
When Misato tells Shinji of her past,\Nhe finds a similar sentiment\Nwithin himself.
The largest Angel yet comes flying\Nthrough the stratosphere, making\Nmany people abandon all hope.
It’s the next episode,\N“The Value of a Miracle is...”
Again, watch it with your friends.

Father...
Thanks, Shinji, you really saved\Nus from that rainstorm.
Where’s Misato?
I guess she must still be asleep.
She’s been working all\Nnight recently.
That’s right, she has a tough job.
We’ve got to be quiet.\NDon’t wake her up.
What are you doing in here?!
Taking shelter from the rain.
You guys are after me, aren’t you?
Well, I’m changing and if\Nyou peep, I’ll kill you!
Shut up, idiot.
Who would want to see\Nyou changing clothes?
She’s way too self-conscious.
Sorry for disturbing you!
Hi, how’s it going?
Shinji, don’t be late tonight,\Nwe’re having a harmonics test.
Right.
Did you hear that, Asuka?
Yes, ma’am!
Congratulations on your promotion!
Congratulations!
Thank you.
You’re most welcome.
See you later.
See you!
What’s up?  Did something\Nhappen to Misato?
Didn’t you see her badge?
The number of lines\Nincreased to two.
That means that she’s been promoted\Nfrom Captain to Major.
Really?  I didn’t notice that.
Yeah, I wonder when...
Are you serious?\NWhat a bunch of dweebs!
Haven’t you got any sympathy?
Don’t you realize how hard it is to\Nfoster two junior high school\Nstudents at her age?
It looks like we’re the only ones who\Nhave some human compassion.
Units 00 and 02 are both on the\Nedge of the contamination zone.\NThey’ve reached their limit.
Unit 01 can still tolerate a little\Nmore though, can’t he?
Lower the graph depth another 0.3.
He’s almost reached the\Ncontamination zone.
And he’s still getting these readings?\NHe’s wonderful.
His harmonics and synch ratio are\Nrapidly catching up with Asuka’s.
It is a talent, isn’t it?
He was born to pilot an Eva,\Nwasn’t he?
Not that he wants to.
I know he’s not happy.
Test completed.  Good work.
Excellent work, Shinji.
What do you mean?
Your harmonics value has increased\Nby eight points since the last test.
That’s very good.
But still it’s fifty points\Nlower than mine!
Yes, but he increased it by eight\Npoints in only ten days.
That’s really something.
It’s not so great!!
Are you happy with your\Nlittle praise?
I’m going home now!  Idiot!!
...and here’s a message for\N“Mr. Waaa” of Tokyo-2.
Having your girlfriend dump you\Nisn’t really such a big deal.
You should be glad that your parents\Nare alive and you have food to eat.
These are better, peaceful times and\Nyou can have hardships like that.
Congratulations!
Thanks, guys!
Thank you, Mister Suzuhara.
No, no.  This wasn’t my brainchild,\Nit was this guy right here.
That’s right!
It was I, Kensuke Aida!\NKensuke Aida was the planner!
Thank you, Mister Aida.
Oh, you’re welcome!  But it’s not\Nsuch a big deal, really.
By the way, why is the\Nclass rep here?
Because I invited her.
Right!
Did you invite Rei too?
Yes, I invited her...
...but that girl is one\Nstrange customer.
Darn, why is Mister Kaji so late?
Oh, Mister Kaji?  Is he that\Nreally cool guy?
Oh, yeah!
He’s so much better than these\Ndweebs that it’s like night and day.
It’s an insult to compare him to them.
What did you say?
How dare you?
I’m okay.
I’m just not used to being with...
...so many people.
Why do they have to...
...make so much noise like that?
Your promotion...
That means that someone must have\Nnoticed the kind of work you’ve\Nbeen doing, right Misato?
Yeah, I suppose.
That’s why they’re happy.
But you don’t look very happy at all.
Oh, I’m happy.  I am.
But that’s not the reason I work here.
Then why did you join NERV?
Well, I don’t remember.\NIt’s been a long time since then.
That’s got to be Kaji!
I came directly from headquarters.\NWe just happened to meet\Non the way.
That’s rather suspicious.
Hey, are you jealous?
Absolutely not.
Anyhow, I’d like to give you my\Nfondest regards, Major Katsuragi.
I suppose I’ll have to be polite\Nto you from now on.
What are you trying to say?\NYou jerk!
You know, it’s unprecedented for\Nboth the Commander and the Vice-\NCommander to leave Japan together.
I guess they must really count\Non ol’ Katsuragi here.
My father’s not here?
Commander Ikari is at the South\NPole at the moment.
Nothing living is allowed to exist\Nin this world of death we\Ncall Antarctica.
Or should I simply call it Hell?
Nevertheless, we, mankind, are here.
We’re living things, and we’re alive.
That’s because we’re under the\Nprotection of science.
Science is the power of man.
That arrogance is what caused the\Ntragedy of fifteen years ago,\Nthe Second Impact.
And here is the end result.
This is a greater punishment\Nthan we deserve.
This is the real Dead Sea.
Yet this is a world that has been\Npurified, purged of the original sin.
I’d rather live in a world where\Npeople can live...
...no matter how stained with sin.
Report from the bridge.
Telegram received from\NNERV Headquarters.
An Angel has been detected in orbit\Nabove the Indian Ocean.
The Angel appeared suddenly,\Ntwo minutes ago.
Send Search Satellite Number 6\Nto that orbit.
T-minus 2 minutes to contact.
The target has been sighted.
That’s impressive.
I don’t believe it.
Satellite Number 6 is closing for\Ncontact with the target.
Commence data search.
Data transmission commencing.
Reception confirmed.
Was that an AT Field?
It’s a new way of using it.
What incredible destructive power.
That’s an AT Field!
It uses kinetic energy, too.
This Angel is, itself,\Nlike a huge bomb.
In any case, the first blast missed its\Ntarget and hit the Pacific Ocean.
Two hours later, the second\Nshot struck there.
Since then, it has been steadily\Ncorrecting the error ratio.
That means it’s learning, huh?
An N2 air bomb had no effect on it.
The Angel has been missing\Nsince then.
It’s probably coming here.
Yes, and next time it may drop itself.
So, that will give us a third\NAshinoko lake?
All five of the Fuji lakes will be\Nfused into a single body linked\Nto the Pacific Ocean...
...destroying this headquarters\Nin the process.
Can we reach the Commander?
It’s impossible due to the Angel’s\Npowerful jamming.
What is the MAGI’s judgment?
They unanimously agree in\Nrecommending evacuation.
What will you do?
You’re the one who’s in charge\Nof all this now.
Notify all of the ministries concerned\Nof the following D-17 Special\NDeclaration...
...as provided for under\NNERV’s authority.
All residents within a radius of 50 km\Nare to evacuate immediately.
Also, ask Matsushiro to\Nback up the MAGI.
Are we going to evacuate as well?
No...
...but it’s not necessary to place\Neveryone at risk.
A D-17 Special Declaration has been\Nannounced by the government.
All residents must evacuate to their\Ndesignated locations.
Beginning with the 6th\Nand 7th blocks...
...move according to your district\Nchief’s direction immediately.
The evacuation of the\Ncity is complete.
The evacuation of all noncombatant\Nand D Class personnel by Alarm C\Nhas been completed.
Are you serious?
Yes, I am.
Are you going to waste all three\NEvas with your irresponsible\Nselfishness?
The chance of success is\Nonly 0.00001%!
That’s not even one in ten thousand!
It’s not zero.  I just trust the Evas.
Major Katsuragi!
I’m in charge.
I have to do what I have to do.
And destroying Angels is my duty.
Your duty?
You must be kidding!
This is for your own sake, isn’t it?
This is just your revenge\Nagainst the Angels!
Catch it in our hands?
That’s right.  We’ll position the Evas\Nin the estimated drop zone.
Then you’ll catch it while\Nmaintaining your AT Fields\Nat full strength.
What if the Angel doesn’t come\Ndown exactly where you\Nexpect it to?
We’ll be a little put out.
What if the Evas aren’t able to\Nwithstand the shock?
We’ll be put out in that case, too.
What’s our probability of success?
God only knows.
I have no idea.
If we succeed, it’ll be a miracle.
It’s not until we’ve done everything\Nwe can to cause a miracle that it\Nbecomes viable.
You mean, we’ve got to be willing to\Nsacrifice ourselves?
I’m sorry, but we have no other\Noptions for this operation.
An operation?  How can you call\Nsomething this crazy an operation?!!
No, you can’t really call it that.
You can refuse to do it, if you wish.
So, are you okay with this?
Regulations say you’re all supposed\Nto write a will.  Have you done that?
I don’t need to.  I’m not going\Nto die just yet.
Neither do I.  There is no use for it.
Not me, either.
Again, I’m sorry.
But once we complete this operation,\NI’ll treat all of you to a steak dinner.
Really?
I promise.
Yeah!!
Don’t forget!
You can count on it.
I guess she thinks a steak dinner is\Nsupposed to impress us.
Does she really think a steak dinner\Nwill impress us?
The Second Impact generation has\Nreally cheap standards.
She can’t help it.
What was with that fake\Ncheer you made?
I just wanted to make her feel\Na little easier about it.
Now, since she’s going to treat us...
...I’d better figure out where to go.
You’ve got to join us this time.
No, I won’t.
Why not?
I dislike meat.
Because of the Angel’s ECM,\Nwe’ve lost track of it.
Since it’s impossible to calculate the\Ncollision point exactly...
...the MAGI’s estimated a drop zone\Nbased on the data that had been\Ncollected before it was lost.
This is it.
The range is this wide?
The distance from one side to\Nthe other is enormous.
Given the size of the target’s\NAT Field...
...it could completely annihilate\Nheadquarters by dropping on\Nany of these locations.
Given that, we’ll disperse the Evas\Nso that there’s one at each of\Nthese three points.
And on what grounds is this\Ndispersal based?
Intuition.
Intuition?
Yes, a woman’s intuition.
How sloppy!  Our miracle is getting\Nfarther and farther away.
Misato has never won the lottery.
Say...
What?
Asuka, why do you pilot an Eva?
To exhibit my talent to\Nthe world, of course.
You mean to prove that you exist?
Yeah, more or less.
You’re not going to ask her?
I’ve asked Ayanami before.
My, how intimate the two of you are.
It’s not like that.
Now, what about you, Shinji?
I don’t know.
You don’t know?\NWhat are you?  Stupid?
Maybe I am.
I suppose you really are.
20 minutes to estimated\Ntime of impact.
You must all evacuate now.
I can take care of this myself.
No, this is our job as well.
That’s right.  We can’t let the kids\Nrisk their lives by themselves.
They’ll be fine.
No matter how badly the Evas might\Nbe damaged, their AT Fields\Nwill protect them.
Inside an Eva is the safest\Nplace to be.
Shinji, yesterday you asked me\Nwhy I joined NERV.
My father was a man who\Nlived for his research...
...for his dreams...\Nto the exclusion of all else.
I could never forgive him for that.
In fact, I even hated him.
Just like my father.
He never took care of me,\Nmy mother or the family.
His friends always said he was\Nvery sensitive and delicate.
But the truth was that he was\Njust a weak person...
...who didn’t want to face reality,\Nthe reality called his family.
He was like a kid...
...so I agreed with my mother when\Nshe decided to divorce him...
...because she was always crying.
He was depressed about it...
...but I laughed at him because he\Ndeserved what he got.
But he sacrificed himself...
...to save my life during\Nthe Second Impact.
Then I didn’t know whether\NI hated him or loved him.
The only thing that was clear to me...
...was that I wanted to destroy the\NAngels who had caused\Nthe Second Impact.
So, in order to do that,\NI joined NERV.
It might be that I still hate him and I\Njust want to avenge my father...
...so that I can free myself of him.
I musn’t run away.\NI musn’t run away.\NI musn’t run away.
Right!
I must NOT run away.
The target has been sighted at\Nmaximum magnification.
Distance is approximately 25,000.
Here it is.
All Evas, start your engines.
We can only give you a rough\Nestimated trajectory based upon\Noptical observations.
So, the MAGI will guide you until\Nthe estimated distance is\N10,000 meters.
After that, you’ll have to use\Nyour own judgment.
I’m placing my trust in you.
The Angel is approaching,\Ndistance 20,000.
Commence operation.
Here we go!
Start!
Distance 12,000!!
AT Field full spread!
Unit 02!  Spread your field!
I’m doing it!!
Do it now!
Our wireless communications\Nhave been restored.
We’re receiving a transmission from\NCommander Ikari in Antarctica.
Connect him here.
Yes, ma’am.
I’m very sorry, sir.
Because of my irresponsible\Njudgment, I have caused Unit 01\Nto incur some damage.
It was completely my fault.
That is not a problem.  Destroying\NAngels is the Evas’ purpose.
It was fortunate that the amount\Nof damage was minimal.
Excellent work, Major Katsuragi.
Thank you, sir.
And on that subject, is the pilot\Nof Unit 01 there?
Y...yes!
I’ve received the report.\NGood work, Shinji.
R...right!
Now, Major Katsuragi, I’ll leave\Nthe handling of the rest of\Nthis in your hands.
Yes, sir.
Next station is New Miyanoshita,\NNew Miyanoshita.
The exit will switch to the left\Nside at the next station.
Now, you’re going to have to\Nfulfill your promise.
Of course...
I’ve withdrawn some large bills from\Nthe bank so I can even pay for a\Nfull course French dinner.
Take it easy, we know how\Npoor you are.
This’ll be fine.
And even Wonder Girl says she’ll\Njoin us for ramen noodles.
I’ll have a garlic ramen with\Nno roast pork.
I’ll have shark’s fin soup ramen\Nwith roast pork.  Large!
There you go!!
Say, Misato...
What?
When I heard my father’s\Nwords today...
...I think I finally understood...
...the good part of being\Npraised by someone.
And I also realized...
...that the reason I pilot my Eva is to\Nhear those words from him.
That’s why you’re a pilot?
You really are an idiot.
The MAGI are a trio of\Nsupercomputers that command\Nall of NERV Headquarters.
They’re usually inspected by\NTechnical Division 1 following each\Nsimulated plug activation.
But then trouble occurs and all of\Nthe underground facilities and even\NCentral Dogma itself are invaded.
Finally, NERV is forced to accept a\Ncourse of self-destruction.
It’s the next episode,\N“Angel Invasion.”
And expect service and\Nmore fan service!
Like an angel that has no\Nsense of mercy...
Rise, young boy, to the heavens\Nlike a legend.
Cold winds, as blue as the sea,
Tear open the door to\Nyour heart, I see.
But unknowing you seem, just\Nstaring at me...
Standing there smiling serenely.
Desperate, for something to touch...
A moment of kindness like\Nthat in a dream.
Your innocent eyes, have yet no idea...
Of the path your destiny will follow.
But someday you’ll become aware of...
Everything that you’ve got behind you.
Your wings are for seeking out a new...
Future that only you can search for.
The cruel angel’s thesis enters through\Nthe window of your soul.
If you should betray the chapel\Nof your memories.
The cruel angel’s thesis bleeds through\Na portal like your pulsing blood.
So, boy, stand tall and embrace\Nthe fire of the legend,
Embracing the universe like\Na blazing star!
Apotheosis for the three Evas will be\Nperformed as soon as the MAGI\Nsystem is reactivated.
Operation confirmed.\NSteps 450–670 are omitted.
Command has granted approval.
You’re fast, Maya, that’s what\Nmakes you you!
Of course, I am.  You trained me.
Wait a second, A-8 would be faster there.
Let me do that.
Well, she was my teacher...
Hey, how’s it going?  Are you finished\Ngiving the MAGI their checkup?
Almost done.  As promised, it’ll be\Nfinished before today’s experiment begins.
You’re something else, Ritsuko.
You’ve got three nearly impossible\Ntasks to handle, and you still manage to\Nbeat the schedule.
That one’s cold.
All three MAGI systems have entered\Nself-diagnostic mode.
The 127th routine maintenance\Nhas been completed.
Confirmed.  Well done, guys.
Take a break until the test begins.
Everything checked out.
As usual, Mother’s in good shape, but...
Is it just me getting older?
What?!  You want me to take\Noff my clothes again?
The next chamber is an\Nultra-clean room environment.
Just taking a shower and changing your\Nundergarments is insufficient.
Why do I have to go through all this\Nfor a simple autopilot test?
With the advance of time, Eva\Ntechnology needs to advance as well.
To do so, we need a constant\Ninflux of new data.
What?!
All right, I’m here, just the way you wanted.
Butt naked and run through\Nthe wash cycle 17 times.
Now, I want all three of you to stay that\Nway as you walk through the room and\Nboard the entry plug.
Whaaaat?!
Don’t worry.  The video recorders\Nhave been shut off.
We do respect your privacy.
That isn’t the point!\NThis is a very personal thing!
The purpose of this experiment\Nis to remove the interference from\Nyour plug suits...
...and monitor the harmonics directly\Nfrom your bodies.
Asuka, that’s an order.
All right!  But I don’t want\Nanybody peeking, okay?
All pilots are ready for entry.
Start the test.
Beginning the test.\NInitiate autopilot recording.
Inserting simulation plug.
Connecting the simulation\Nbodies to the systems.
The simulation plugs are now\Nunder the MAGI’s control.
Wow, that was really fast.\NThe MAGI are magnificent!
It’s hard to believe that the first\Nexperiment took a whole week.
According to the schedule,\Nthe test will end in three hours.
How do you feel?
It feels odd.
Yeah, it’s different from the other times.
Something’s wrong with my senses.
My right arm’s the only thing I can feel\Nclearly, everything else is fuzzy.
Rei, imagine moving your right hand.
Yes, ma’am.
Data collection is proceeding nicely.
Everything seems good so far.
Return the MAGI to their normal state.
A dilemma...
You can sure feel the creator’s\Npersonality, can’t you?
What are you talking about?  You’re\Nthe one who created them, aren’t you?
You don’t know anything, do you?
That’s because you never talk about\Nyourself like I do, Ritsuko!
That’s true.  I just created\Nthe system uplinks.
The person who developed the basic\Ntheorems and the mainframe...
...was my mother.
Are you double-checking this?
Yes, I am.
These are the parts that were\Nbrought in three days ago.
These are the parts that are showing\Nsigns of deterioration.
The 87th protein wall.
With magnification,\Nyou can see some spots.
Can you tell me what it is?
It’s got to be corrosion.
There are slight variations\Nin the temperature and conduction\Nrates of the spots.
Deterioration of sterilized rooms\Nhappens a lot, an awful lot, as of late.
The construction schedule was\Ncut by about 60 days.
It’s possible that some air bubbles\Nmay have gotten inside.
There are a lot of flaws in the\Nconstruction of Wing B.
This building was constructed after the\NAngels appeared, remember?
You can’t really put the blame\Non anyone; everybody was\Nso exhausted back then.
Take care of it by tomorrow.
Otherwise, Ikari will be jumping all\Nover our asses for it.
Understood.
Another water leak?
No, it’s some kind of corrosion in the\Nprotein wall above this floor.
Wonderful.
Could it have any effect on this test?
No, not at the moment.
Then let’s continue.
We can’t abort complex experiments\Ndue to minor technical problems.
Otherwise, Commander Ikari will be\Njumping all over our asses for it.
Understood.
Synchronization position is correct.
Connecting the simulation entry plugs to\Nthe Evas via the simulation bodies.
Contact with Eva Unit 00\Nhas been confirmed.
AT Field will be generated on two.
What’s happening?!
We’ve got a contamination alert\Nin the Sigma Unit on Floor A!
The 87th protein wall is corroding\Nand releasing heat!
We’ve detected an abnormality\Nin the 6th pipe as well!
Corrosion of the protein wall is\Nincreasing at an incredible rate!
Abort the experiment!
Shut off the 6th pipe!
Right!
Numbers 60, 38 and 39 are all closed!
Corrosion has occurred in 6-42!
No effect!  Corrosion is spreading\Nalong the walls!
Prepare the polysomes.
Set laser power at maximum!\NShoot the invasive particles!
Corrosion has reached 6-58!  It’s here!
Rei!
Rei’s simulation body is moving!
Impossible!
The corrosion is still spreading!
It’s invading the simulation bodies’\Nactive water system!
How’s Rei?!
She’s all right!
Eject all plugs immediately!
Hurry up with that laser!
An AT Field?!
Impossible!
What?
The pattern analysis is blue!
There’s no question, it’s an Angel!
An Angel?!\NYou let an Angel get inside?
I’m sorry, sir.
This isn’t the time for excuses!
I want a physical shutdown of Central\NDogma!  Isolate it from Sigma Unit!
Initiating physical shutdown of Central\NDogma.  Isolating from Sigma Unit.
What the hell are you doing?  Hurry!
Isolating Sigma Unit from Floor B.
Closing all partitions.\NAll personnel in the area must evacuate.
I know.  Please take care of it.
Stop the alert.
S...stopping the alarm, sir.
This is a malfunction.\NAn error in the alarm system.
Report that to both the Japanese\Ngovernment and the committee.
Y...yes, sir!
The contaminated area is\Nstill descending.
It’s spreading all over Sigma Unit\Nfrom the Pribnow Box!
That’s a critical area.
Yes, it’s too close to Adam.
Stop the corrosion within Sigma Unit!
If necessary, sacrifice the Geo-Front.\NWhat’s the Evas’ status?
Ready in the 7th cage.
We can launch them as soon as the\Npilots are recovered.
There’s no need to wait for the pilots.\NLaunch them immediately!
Launch Unit 01 first.\NSacrifice the other two if necessary.
Unit 01 has top priority?
But sir, we can’t destroy the\NAngel without the Evas.
If the Evas are contaminated first,\Nwe’ll be finished!  Hurry!
Roger!
All of Central Dogma under Sigma Unit\Nwill be shut down in 60 seconds.
Central Dogma has been\Ncompletely sealed.
Mega-depth facilities are all\Noccupied by the intruder!
Well now, how will we mount an\Noffensive against an Angel\Nwithout an Eva?
Look, this is the border between\Nthe normal and heavy water.
There’s a higher level of oxygen here.
Their preference is pretty obvious.
The place where ozone is vented in\Nto maintain aseptic conditions\Nisn’t contaminated.
So, does that mean ozone is its weakness?
It would seem so.
Injecting ozone.\NOzone concentration is increasing.
It’s working, all right.
Will this work?
Zero A and Zero B seem\Nto be recovering.
The area around the pipes is\Ngetting back to normal.
The center portion is proving\Na little more difficult.
All right, inject more ozone.
This isn’t right.
What?  It’s increasing?
Something is wrong.\NHeat levels are increasing!
The contaminated area is\Nspreading again!
The ozone is no longer\Nhaving any effect.
Now it’s absorbing the ozone!
Stop the ozone injection!!
Amazing...
It’s evolving.
What’s wrong?
Something’s hacking into the\Nsub-computer.  The intruder hasn’t\Nbeen identified.
Not now!  Dealing with C-Mode!
Unfreeze the barrier.  Open a decoy entry.
Decoy entry has been avoided.
T-minus 18 seconds to\Ncompletion of trace.
Spreading barrier!
Barrier has been penetrated!
Open another false entry!
No human being could do this.
The trace is complete.\NThe hacker is inside this facility!
It’s in Wing B, in the Pribnow Box!
Optical pattern is changing!
Those glowing lines look like electronic\Ncircuits!  This is just like a computer!
Opening decoy entry!
It failed!  There’s interference!
Cut off the main cable!
Negative, it refuses to accept\Nthe command!
Fire the laser!!
It’s generating an AT Field!  No effect!
It’s accessing the main security bank!\NIt’s cracking the pass code.
12th digit...  16th digit...\ND-Word has been cleared!
It’s broken into the main banks!
It’s reading the main bank!\NWe can’t stop it!
What does it want?
Scanning the main directories.
This code is...  my God!
It’s going after the MAGI!
Shut down the I/O system!
Countdown!
3...
2...
One!
We can’t shut it down!
The Angel is intruding further\Ninto the computers!
It’s made contact with Melchior!
It’s no good!\NThe Angel is taking over Melchior!
Melchior is being re-programmed\Nby the Angel!
Melchior’s self-destruct\Nhas been initiated.
Overruled.  Overruled.  Overruled.\NOverruled.
Damn, it’s too fast!!
What calculation speed!
Change the logic mode!\NChange synchronization code to\Nevery 15 seconds!
Roger!
How much time did we buy?
At least two hours, I think.
The MAGI have become our enemy.
This Angel must be composed of\Na group of micromachines,\Neach the size of a virus.
These micromachines group\Ntogether to form colonies.
In a very short period of time,\Nthey have exponentially evolved to form\Na sophisticated intelligence circuit.
Evolved...
Yes...
They’re continuously changing...
...to form the best system to cope\Nwith any environment.
That’s their survival mechanism\Nas a life form.
Against an enemy that constantly\Nevolves to overcome its weaknesses...
...the only effective countermeasure\Nis to eliminate the host and let\Nthe parasite die with it.
The only option is to order the\NMAGI to commit suicide.
I propose the physical elimination\Nof the MAGI.
That’s impossible.
Destroying the MAGI means destroying\Nheadquarters itself.
Then, I’m officially requesting it on\Nbehalf of the Operations Division.
I reject it.
This is a matter for the\NTechnology Department.
Why are you being so mule-headed?!
This situation is a result of\Nmy carelessness.
Why do you always have\Nto be like this?
You’re always taking all the\Nresponsibility on your own shoulders...
...and avoiding depending on anyone.
As long as this Angel keeps evolving,\Nwe have a chance.
Expedite its evolution?
Yes...
The end of evolution is self-destruction...\Ndeath itself.
Thus, we just need to accelerate\Nits evolution.
If the Angel considers it the only\Npractical means of survival...
...it may choose to coexist with\Nthe MAGI system.
But how?
If the Angel is a computer itself...
...we can reverse-hack by connecting\NCasper to the Angel...
...and uploading a self-destruct\Nprogram, but...
...at the same time, we’ll be turning off\Nthe barrier to the Angel.
So, either Casper or the Angel,\Nwhichever is faster, will win.
Yes...
Will the program be ready in time?\NIf Casper is taken over first,\Nit’ll all be over.
I keep my promises.
Red alert!  Red alert!
An emergency has occurred\Nin NERV Headquarters.
All D-class personnel must evacuate.
Wh...what are those?
These are notes by the developer.
My gosh!  These are access codes!\NMAGI’s access codes!
It’s like a special map to all of the\NMAGI’s back doors!
Am I allowed to see these?
I can’t believe it!  These are in INT-C!
With these we can program much\Nfaster than we thought!
Thank you, Mom.  We can make it.
Give me the wrench.
Doesn’t this remind you of\Nour college days?
Now, board number 25.
Hey, why don’t you tell me something\Nabout the MAGI?  Just a little?
It’s a long story.
A long, boring story.
Do you know about the\Npersonality transplant OS?
It’s for implanting an individual’s\Npersonality into a seventh generation\Ncomputer so it can think for itself.
The same technology is used for\Noperating the Evas.
I’ve heard that the MAGI’s\Nprogramming used one of the\Nfirst test subjects.
My mother developed the technology...
So, it was her personality that\Nwas transplanted?
Right!
In a very real sense,\Nthese brains are my mother.
Is that why you wanted to\Nprotect the MAGI?
I don’t think so.\NI didn’t really like my mom.
This was a decision as a scientist.
It’s starting!
Balthasar is being taken over!
The self-destruct sequence has been\Ninitiated by the computer.
Self-destruct will be triggered 20\Nseconds after all three AI consent.
The area of destruction will be geoid\Ndepth -280, -140 and Floor 0.
Special Command 582 requires the consent\Nof two computers to cancel the action.
What speed!
T-minus 20 to self-destruct.
My God!
Casper will be taken over\Nin 18 seconds!
T-minus 15 to self-destruct.
Ritsuko, hurry!
7...
6...
4...
3...
2...
1...
Zero.
Self-destruct has been canceled\Nby the computer.
All right!
Special Command 582\Nis also canceled.
The MAGI are returning to\Nnormal mode.
The red alert has been canceled.\NThe red alert has been canceled.
All hands return to first stage alert.
Jesus!  I can’t get out with\Nno clothes on!
Somebody, help me fast!
Sigma Unit has been released.\NT-minus 03 to MAGI reactivation.
I’m getting old.  Staying up for\Nthese all-nighters is rough.
You kept your promise again.
Good job.
Thank you.
This is the first time I’ve ever really\Nappreciated your coffee.
The night before she died, my mother\Ntold me that the MAGI are three\Naspects of herself.
Herself as a scientist...
Herself as a mother...
Herself as a woman...
Those three aspects of her\Nare struggling for dominance inside\Nthe MAGI.
She intentionally implanted the\Ndilemmas of the human\Nexperience into them.
Actually, each of the three programs\Nare slightly different as well.
I don’t think I’ll ever be a mother, and I\Ndon’t really understand her as a mother.
I respected her as a scientist.
However, as a woman, I hated her.
You’re rather talkative today.
Only sometimes.
Casper contains the program\Nof her as a woman.
She stayed a woman to the last.\NHow totally like my mother...
SEELE is the secret organization that\Nmanipulates both NERV and the\NHuman Instrumentality Project.
Together, with Ikari, they verify the\Nevents of both the past and present.
Are the Angel attacks and Ikari’s\Nbehavior actually reenactments of the\NDead Sea Scrolls?
Is every phenomenon simply following\Na prescribed scenario?
Is human hope even projected?
It’s the next episode,\N“SEELE, Throne of Souls.”
And there’ll be more fan\Nservice next time, too!

Although there was a great deal of\Ndamage as a result...\N\N\N\N\N\N\N
...the fact that a boy with no prior\Nexperience completed a mission against\Nan unknown enemy...
...makes Shinji Ikari deserving of\Nspecial notice.
However, for the Department of\NStrategic Operations, it was a battle\Nthat revealed many problems.
My sister’s only in the 2nd grade.
She got hurt in that stupid disturbance,\Nand she was hurt by our own stupid\Nrobot, not by the enemy.
There’s no way I can forgive anyone\Nwho did something so stupid.
I’m going to let them feel my anger\Nand teach the jerks who hurt my\Nsister a lesson.
We’d already had a lot of evacuation\Ntraining at the school, so we didn’t really\Nthink it was so serious.
All the guys were acting like jerks, like\Nthey were on a field trip, and none of\Nthe girls were afraid either.
Ikari didn’t actually tell me anything,\Nso this is just a guess on my part.
I think Ayanami tried to sacrifice herself\Nto protect Unit 01 from the enemy’s\Nparticle beam attack.
I’m really sure about this,\Nand the reason I’m so positive\Nis Ayanami herself.
I think that Ayanami really doesn’t have\Na great deal of respect for the value\Nof her own existence.
It’s not just that she’s more\Npessimistic than normal 14-year-olds,\Nit’s something much, much more.
This did not occur in accordance\Nwith our scenario.
Nevertheless, the result was within the\Nprojected parameters.  We can make\Nthe necessary adjustments.
The UN Navy lost a third of its\Nentire fleet in this encounter.
The lost ships belonged to your country.\NThe damage is negligible.
True, it was quite fortunate that so much\Nof the damage was inconsequential.
This is no good.
It’s happening too early.
That’s true.  This did not occur in\Naccordance with our predictions of\Nwhen an Angel would invade NERV.
And to make it worse, you let it intrude\Ninto Central Dogma itself!
If contact had occurred then, our entire\Nproject could have ended in disaster.
The report to this committee was in error.\NThere is no truth behind this tale\Nof an Angel invasion.
Are you saying that the Eleventh Angel’s\Nintrusion did not occur, Ikari?
Correct.
Speak with caution, Ikari.\NMaking false statements to this\Nconference is punishable by death.
Check the MAGI’s recorders.\NNothing concerning such an incident\Nwas recorded.
This is absurd.\NHiding the truth is your specialty.
The time schedule is being carried out in\Naccordance with the details prescribed\Nby the Dead Sea Scrolls.
All right.  We won’t discuss any possible\Nguilt or punishment at this time.
But let me remind you that you won’t\Ncreate a new scenario.
I understand.  Everything is proceeding\Naccording to SEELE’s plan.
Mountain...
Heavy are the mountains.\NBut that changes over time.
Sky...
Blue sky.
What your eyes can’t see.
What your eyes can see.
Sun...
There is only one.
Water...\NComforting.
Commander Ikari?
Flower...
So many alike.
So many useless.
Sky...
Red, red sky.
Red is the color.
Red is the color I hate.
Water flowing.
Blood...
The smell of blood.
A woman who never bleeds.
From the red earth comes man,\Nfrom the soil.
Born of man and woman is man.
Town...\NA human creation.
Eva...\NA human creation as well.
What is human?\NA creation of God?
Is it a human creation?
The things I possess are\Nmy life and soul.
I am a vessel for my heart.
Entry plug...\NThe throne of a soul.
Who is this?  This is me.
Who am I?
What am I?  What am I?\NWhat am I?  What am I?
I am myself.
This, that which is, is myself.\NThat which is formed is me.
This is the me that can be seen,\Nyet it feels as if this is not myself.
A strange feeling.
I feel as if my body is melting.
I can no longer see myself.\NMy shape is fading.
I feel the presence of someone\Nwho is not me.
Who is there, beyond me here?
Ikari?
I know this person.\NShe is Major Katsuragi.
Doctor Akagi.
Others.
Classmates.
The pilot of Unit 02.
Commander Ikari?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
So, how does it feel to be piloting\NUnit 01 for the first time?
It smells like Ikari.
Her synch ratio is almost the same\Nas with Unit 00.
Unit 00 and 01’s personal data patterns\Nare almost identical as well.
That’s what makes this synch\Nexperiment possible.
Error is 0.03.  Harmonics are normal.
No detectable problems found for\Ncompatibility between Rei and Unit 01.
Okay, the experiment is finished, Rei.
You can get out now.
Yes.
Data bank for Unit 02 complete.
Harmonics are all normal.
Pilot status: normal.
Of course.
What about Unit 00’s personal data?
Already reconfigured.\NCurrently reconfirming it.
Subject status?
He’s a bit nervous, but no problems are\Nbeing found in his nerve patterns.
This is his first time in Unit 00...
...and his first time piloting any\Nother Eva.  That’s natural.
Nonsense, why should he care?
He’s Shinji.
I know it, and that’s why he’s stupid.
Speaking of which, why don’t I have to\Ntake the compatibility experiment?
You don’t want to pilot any\Nother Evas, do you?
Darn right.
Entry has commenced.
LCL electrolyzed.
Initiating first connection.
Shinji, how do you feel in\NUnit 00’s entry plug?
It feels kind of odd.
A sense of incompatibility?
Not like that, but...
...it smells like Rei.
What does that mean?  He’s a pervert!
Data received.  Reconfirming.\NPattern Green.
Main power supply\Nconnection complete.
All restraints are normal.
Acknowledged.
Now let’s shift the mutual compatibility\Ntests to the second stage.
Unit 00 will enter into second contact.
How is it?
As I thought, the synch ratio is\Nlower than that of Unit 01.
Harmonics are all normal.
But these are still good readings.
This means that we can\Naccomplish the plan.
The dummy system, you mean?\NI disagree...
I understand your feelings on this,\Nbut we always have to be prepared in\Norder to guarantee survival.
I highly respect you, ma’am, and I will\Ndo my duty, but I am not convinced\Nabout this project.
People with a fastidious nature will\Nalways feel some difficulty living\Namongst others.
Once you’ve been sullied, you’ll\Nregretfully find the truth in this.
Initiating third connection.
Self state of psychograph is stable.
Hey, Shinji, what’s it like?\NMom’s breast?  Or inside her womb?
Asuka, stop interrupting.\NThe noise can penetrate.
Yes, ma’am.
Why do they spoil Shinji?
Commence linkage of\NA-10 nerve connections.
Harmonics level up 20.
What is this?  Something’s trying\Nto get into my brain...
A...Ayanami?
Rei Ayanami?
This impression is Rei, isn’t it?
Ayanami?
Isn’t it her?
What is it?
We’ve got a problem occurring in\Nthe pilot’s nerve pulse!
Mental contamination is taking place!
Impossible!  This can’t happen\Nat this plug depth.
It’s not from the plug!
The intrusion’s coming from the Eva!
Unit 00 is out of control!
Shut off all circuits!\NCut the power supply!
Eva has switched to backup power.
The Eva is still active!
How’s Shinji?
The circuit is closed!
We can’t monitor him!
Unit 00 is rejecting Shinji?!
Negative!  The auto ejection’s not working!
The same thing as before?
Is it going to try to absorb Shinji?
Rei, get back!!
Activation will be terminated in 10...
Activation will be terminated in 10...
9...
8...
7...
6...
5...
4...
3...
2...
1...
Zero!
Unit 00 has ceased activation.
Hurry up and rescue the pilot!!
Was this somehow related to the\Nearlier berserk incident when\NRei was the pilot?
I can’t tell you much right now.
The only thing I’m sure of is that\Nwe must reconfigure Unit 00 for Rei’s\Npersonal data...
...and run a new synchronization\Ntest between them as soon\Nas possible.
As Director of Strategic Ops, I ask\Nthat you do so as soon as possible,\Nbefore it creates more problems.
I understand that, Major Katsuragi.
The next contestant for the\NWorld’s Most Amazing Exhibition is,\NMath Puppy!
Wow, that sounds awesome!
Here we go, math genius puppy,\NKana, from Niigata!
Wan!
He sounds good.\NDo you understand me?
Wan!
Oh, right.  Now let’s ask him.
Wan!
What is 325 minus 324?
Wan!
This is amazing!  He’s correct!
Shinji’s conscious.\NNo signs of mental contamination.
He doesn’t remember what happened.
I see.
Hi!  I’m fine, but the world is worrisome\Ndue to terrorism in the Nansa Islands.
About that Angel invasion that\Ndeviated from the plan.
The Instrumentality Committee is\Napplying pressure regarding the facts\Nof that incident.
They’re just riff-raff who can’t do\Nanything except complain.
We hold all the tiles.\NThere is nothing they can do.
But we don’t want to irritate them.\NIf SEELE starts interfering,\Nthere could be trouble.
Everything has been carried out\Nas the scenario required.\NThere is no problem.
What about the Unit 00 incident?\NThat wasn’t in my scenario.
It will not interfere.
The re-synchronization test for Rei and\NUnit 00 was successful.
What is the status of the Adam Project?
Proceeding without difficulty.  It is less\Nthan two percent behind schedule.
Then, the Lance of Longinus is...
It’s going as we planned.
Rei is carrying out the operation.
With her friends getting married\None after another, Misato\Nbegins to feel uneasy.
She could end up being a perpetual\Nwedding shower attendee and never\Nhave anyone for herself.  This stinks!
Her twenties are running out and\Nher thirties are approaching!
Could a reunion with Kaji\Nbe her last chance?
Next episode: “Lie and Silence.”
And there’ll be lots more\Nfan service again!
Like an angel that has no\Nsense of mercy...
Rise, young boy, to the heavens\Nlike a legend.
Cold winds, as blue as the sea,
Tear open the door to\Nyour heart, I see.
But unknowing you seem, just\Nstaring at me...
Standing there smiling serenely.
Desperate, for something to touch...
A moment of kindness like\Nthat in a dream.
Your innocent eyes, have yet no idea...
Of the path your destiny will follow.
But someday you’ll become aware of...
Everything that you’ve got behind you.
Your wings are for seeking out a new...
Future that only you can search for.
The cruel angel’s thesis enters through\Nthe window of your soul.
If you should betray the chapel\Nof your memories.
The cruel angel’s thesis bleeds through\Na portal like your pulsing blood.
So, boy, stand tall and embrace\Nthe fire of the legend,
Embracing the universe like\Na blazing star!
The second and third Ashino Lakes, I\Nhope there won’t be any more of those.
I received a complaint from Chairman\NKeel yesterday regarding the delay.\NHe came directly to me.
He was very upset.  Towards the end,\Nhe even threatened to dismiss you.
Adam is growing well...
...and work on the dummy plugs for\Nthe Eva Project is proceeding.
What are the old men of SEELE\Ncomplaining about now?
The all-important Instrumentality\NProject is behind schedule.
All the projects are linked.\NThere are no problems.
Including Rei?
Well, never mind.
By the way, what should\Nwe do about that man?
Leave him alone for now.  The same\Nwith the Marduk Institute.
I agree, let him work for us a while.
What started here, 16 years ago?
It’s me.
Ah, so it is.
Shannon Bio, a foreign chemical firm.
This has been here for nine years, nine\Nyears and not a single change.
The Marduk Institute has 108 affiliated\Ncompanies.  106 of them are\Ndummy corporations.
And this is the 107th?
This is the corporate registration.
And you want me to take a look at the\Nboard of directors, don’t you?
You know about it already?
I know all of the names.
Marduk is supposedly an advisory\Nbody controlled by the Instrumentality\NCommittee to select Evangelion pilots.
What it really does is not clear.
Your duty is to investigate NERV.\NGetting involved with the Marduk\NInstitute is inappropriate.
Well, be that as it may, I want to see\Neverything for myself.
Hi, this is Kaji.  I’m out right now.
Please leave your name and message.
Help me, Kaji!\NDon’t touch me, you pervert!
That’ll do it!
What’s going on?
Well, I want to go out tomorrow.
So I’ve been calling Kaji to ask him to\Ntake me, but he’s been out.
He’s always out lately.
So you’ll have time tomorrow?
Regrettably so.
Then, I have a favor to ask you.
Well, it’s like this...
A date?!
A friend of my big sister,\NKodama, keeps asking me to\Nintroduce you to him.
I beg you!
Get to work!
I’m sorry.
YOU!  Get to work!
Necrosis operation complete.
Graph measurement complete.
For the wedding?
I wore the pink suit for\NKiyomi’s wedding...
...and the dark blue dress for\NKotoko’s shower...
What about the orange one?
You haven’t worn that one\Nlately, have you?
Well, there’s a reason for that...
It’s too tight?
Yeah, so what?!
Should I get a new one\Non the way home?
It’s an extra expense.
We’ve been invited to so many\Nshowers lately...
...that the cost of all the gifts\Nis starting to add up.
Everyone’s just rushing to get married\Nbefore they’re thirty.
No one wants to be the\Nlast one still single.
Okay, you can take off now.
Good work.
I’m tired of these stupid tests.
By the way, Shinji looks even more\Ndowncast than usual today.
That’s because of tomorrow.
Yeah, tomorrow.
Tomorrow...  I have to see my father.
What should I talk to him about?
Why do you ask me?
Because I’ve seen you talking\Nhappily with him.
Say, my father...\Nwhat kind of person is he?
I don’t know.
I see.
You’ve been watching me because you\Nwanted to ask me that?
When we were cleaning today...
...you were squeezing the cloth.
The way you squeezed it\Nwas like a mother.
A mother...
I thought it was like a mother.
I think you’ll make a good\Nmother, Ayanami.
You’re embarrassing me.
What’s up?\N\N\N
...that’s the problem.\N\N\N
Go away!
Well done, Shinji.
Shinji?
I’m opening the door.
Are you scared?\NOf seeing your father by yourself?
Don’t run away.
Unless you step forward,\Nnothing will change.
I know that!
You’ll begin to realize...
...after that first step, it’s just as\Nimportant to take another step.
Anyway, go see him tomorrow with\Nyour chin held high...
...because you’ll be seeing your\Nmother, too.
Well, good night.
Hey, you bought a new dress for\Ntomorrow, didn’t you?  Lemme see!
Oh, you wanna see?\NIt’s an expensive one.
The price doesn’t always\Nreflect the design.
Tell me about it.
Did you pick one to Kaji’s taste?
I don’t think so.  Not anymore.
Well...
...see you...
...later.
Place three bags in your heart...
Ladybugs with red, blue\Nand yellow dresses...
Now, let us proceed with\Nthe reception...
Little Ryo’s late.
That idiot has never been on\Ntime in his entire life!
For your dates, you mean?\NHe’s always on time for work.
Hey, girls!\NYou look marvelous today!
I couldn’t get off work.
I don’t believe that,\Nyou never do anything anyway.
Why didn’t you shave?  That stubble’s\Nawful.  Look, your necktie is crooked.
Well, thank you.
You two act like you’re married.
Good point, Ri-baby.
Who the hell would marry this dork!
It’s been three years since the last time\Nwe came here together.
I ran away then...
...and haven’t been back since.
My mother is resting here...
...I don’t really believe that.
I don’t even remember her face.
Man survives by forgetting\Nhis memories.
But there are some things a man\Nshould never forget.
Yui taught me about the\Nirreplaceable things.
I come here to confirm that.
You have no pictures of her?
There are none.
This grave is merely a decoration, too.\NThere’s no corpse.
So the teacher was right.\NYou threw them away.
I keep everything in my heart.\NThat is enough.
It’s time.  I’m leaving now.
Father!
Well...  I’m glad...\Nwe could talk today.
Indeed...
Not bad!  I didn’t know you played.
I’ve been studying since I was five,\Nbut I’m not very good.
I don’t really have any talent.
“Perseverance is power.”\NI’m impressed.
I started studying because my\Nteacher told me to, but I could\Nhave quit anytime.
So why didn’t you?
Because nobody told me to stop.
I should have known!
You came back early.\NI thought you’d have dinner, too.
He was just so boring!
So while he was waiting in line for\Nthe roller coaster, I left.
That’s harsh.
Really, Kaji is the only cool guy.
It’s getting late.
I’m going to the bathroom.
Are you gonna leave me alone?
We haven’t really gotten together to\Ndrink lately, have we?
Misato’s drinking too much, isn’t she?
She’s acting a little out of control.
Sometimes one drinks to keep oneself\Nunder control.
We all do.
As someone who lived with her, your\Nwords carry a certain weight of truth.
Well, I did live with her, but that\Nwas before Katsuragi started wearing\Nheels like a real woman.
That’s not how we saw it back\Nwhen we were in school.
I was a kid.
That wasn’t really life.\NKid’s play is what it was.
Life isn’t that easy.
Oh yeah, I forgot to give you this.\NA souvenir from a cat.
Oh, thank you.  You’re very honest.
Only with the ladies.\NWhen it comes to work, I’m less so.
I somehow doubt that.
What about Misato?
I lost once before.
It’s not my style to keep fighting a\Nbattle I’m sure to lose.
I think you still have a chance to win.
What about you?
It’s my policy to never\Ntalk about myself.
There’s nothing amusing about me.
Why is Katsuragi taking so long?\NFixing her make-up maybe?
What were you doing in Kyoto?
No, that’s from Matsushiro.
Don’t try to fool me.
You’ll get your fingers burned if you\Nget involved in this too deeply.
That’s the advice of a friend.
I’ll take it seriously...
...but I’d prefer to be burned by the\Nheat of my passion for you.
Welcome back!
You never change, do you?
Of course I change,\Nliving means changing.
Homeostasis and transistasis.
What are those?
One is a force to maintain the\Nstatus quo, and the other is\Na force for change.
Anything that contains these two\Nconflicting forces is alive.
Like men and women.
Well, I’ll be leaving now.\NI’ve still got some work to do.
Really?
Sorry to hear it.
Later.
Hey, Shinji?  It’s me.
I’m with Kaji.\NWe’re gonna be out drinking.
Yes...  okay, later.
Was it Misato?
Yeah, she’ll be late,\Nso don’t wait up for her.
Is she gonna stay out until morning?
I don’t think so, she’s with Kaji.
Are you an idiot?!
That guarantees it!
Drinking so much you throw up like\Na kid!  How old are you?
I know, but I’m not a kid.
Well, neither of us are.
Damn right.
I can’t believe you wear high\Nheels now, Katsuragi.
Time’s really flown.
Rough face...  You need to shave.
I can walk now.  Thank you.
Kaji, do you think I’ve changed?
You’re even more beautiful.
I’m sorry that I insisted on\Nbreaking up with you.
When I said I had somebody else,\Nyou knew...
...that it was a lie, didn’t you?
No.
It’s just that I realized...
...you were so much like\Nmy late father, Kaji.
When...
...I realized that I wanted a man...
...like my father, I was terrified.
I was so afraid.
Being with you, Kaji...
...being a woman...
...everything scared me.
I hated my father, but fell in love with\Nsomeone just like him.
I chose to break everything\Noff and join NERV.
However, it turned out that my father\Nhad worked for NERV, too.
I tried to bury my feelings by swearing\Nvengeance against the Angels.
That was your decision, Katsuragi.
You don’t have to be sorry.
No!  That wasn’t a decision!
I just escaped from reality.
Escaped from the reality\Ncalled “Father”!
I’m just like Shinji.
I’m a coward.
I’m really sorry.  I had to get drunk\Njust to tell you this.
That’s enough...
I’m just a child myself.
I have no right to tell Shinji anything.
That’s enough.
I’m a coward!\NI just use men when I need to.
In the past, Kaji, I may have just...\Njust used you!
I’m so pathetic!
That’s enough!  Stop it!
I can’t stand myself!
Hey, Shinji, do you want to kiss me?
What?
Then, let’s do it.
But why?!
Because I’m bored.
Is that a reason?!
Do you not want to kiss on the\Nanniversary of your mom’s death?
Afraid she may be watching\Nyou from heaven?
It’s not that.
Are you scared?
Why would I be scared of a kiss?!
You brushed your teeth, didn’t you?
Then, here I come.
Stop breathing, it tickles me.
I should never kiss to kill time!
All right, here we are.  Hang on.
Kaji...
Kaji!
Well, I’ll be leaving now.
Why don’t you stay with us, Kaji?
I’d be laughed at if I went\Nto work in this.
It’ll be okay.
Hey, Kaji, it’ll...
Later.
Lavender perfume...
Please take care of Katsuragi.
Sure.
Well, night.
Good night.
What’s wrong?  You look sad.
It’s because you kissed me!!
Well, let me call the girls’ roll...\NAyanami...
Oh, Ayanami’s absent again?
Hi, how are you feeling today?
I’m sober now, thanks.
I’m glad to hear that.
Is this your real job or your other job?
What do you think?
Ryoji Kaji of NERV’s Special\NInspection Department...
...and at the same time Ryoji Kaji of\Nthe Japanese Department of Interior.
Oh, so you know.
You underestimate NERV.
Is this an order from\NCommander Ikari?
No, my sole discretion.  If you keep\Ndoing this other job, you’ll die.
As long as Commander Ikari is using\Nme, too, I can still do it.
However, let me apologize for using\Nyou, Major Katsuragi.
It’ll make us even for your\Nhelp yesterday.
Thanks very much...  but...
...the Commander and Ritsuko are\Nhiding something from you, too, and...
...this is it.
This is...
Eva?  No!
Impossible...
Yes, this is the source of\Neverything since the Second Impact.\NThe most important factor.
This is Adam.
Adam?  Why is the First Angel here?
You’re right.
I don’t know NERV at all.
Shinji Ikari gets ahead of Asuka\Nand jumps to the top place in the\Nsynch tests.
He’s proud, but then he’s swallowed\Nby a Sea of Dirac.
With Eva’s energy supply running out,\Nfear, loneliness and cold crash\Nin upon him...
...teaching him a new level of\Nanguish and despair!
It’s the next episode,\N“Sickness Unto Death, and...”
Of course, we’ll give you some\Nmore fan service, too!

Hey, Shinji, did you change\Nthe soup stock?
Yeah, to dried fish flavor.\NIt’s a gift from Ritsuko.
Too hot!
I’m sorry.
You’re always apologizing!  Do you\Nalways think you’re the one at fault?
Shinji, apologies are your conditioned\Nreflex to any kind of confrontation!
I’m sorry.
Exactly like that.\NYou’re too self-deprecating!
Now, now, that’s just his way.
It’s so easy to just accept his\Npathetic habits, isn’t it?!
But haven’t you been a little\Ntoo easy on Shinji lately?
Have I?
Maybe you and Kaji have\Nhooked up again...
...but the fact that you’re happy doesn’t\Nmean that you can just ignore us.
There’s nothing between me and Kaji.
Hey, Katsuragi, I’ve found a bar\Nthat serves a decent drink.\NHow ‘bout tonight?  Bye!
I’ve never been around anyone involved\Nin such an indecent relationship before!
You’re supposed to be our guardian!\NYou hypocrite!
It’s disgusting!!
B-type harmonics test, all green.
Projected adjustment values\Nhave been cleared.
You look tired, Misato.
Yeah, for a lot of private reasons.
Kaji?
Shut up!
Well, how’s the Third Child doing?
Take a look.
Let me see.
I hope that knowing this will\Nboost his confidence.
Can you hear me, Shinji?
Misato!  How were my test scores?
Yes!  You are Number One!
I lost!
He beat us easily.
He beat us so easily it’s pissing me off!
He’s great, wonderful, awesome,\Ntoo awesome!
The invincible Shinji!
So that makes our job a\Nlittle easier, right?
But it also means that we’ll have to do our\Nbest to not be left behind.
Goodbye.
Next stop is Seisho Kabuse.\NNext stop, Seisho Kabuse.
Convenient to the Bashar, used books\Nand video game stores...
Good.
Five minutes until evacuation of the\NWestern District is completed.
Target is advancing slowly\Nat 2.5 km per hour.
You’re late.
I’m sorry.
What’s going on?\NThe observation center in Fuji...
...didn’t detect it.  It just suddenly\Nappeared directly above us.
Pattern Orange.  No AT Field detected.
What is this?
A new kind of Angel?
The MAGI are withholding judgment.
Damn!  A situation like this and\NCommander Ikari’s not here.
Can you all hear me?
I’ve sent you all of the target’s data.
This is all we know right now.
Approach it carefully and observe\Nits reactions and, if possible,\Nlure it outside of the city limits.
Two of you will back up\Nthe other, got that?
All right, ma’am, but I think Shinji\Nought to take point.
Well, this is a job for the highest rated,\Nbravest, Number One synchro-ratio\Nholder, right?
Or don’t you feel up to it, Shinji?
No, I can do it.
I’ll show you how it ought\Nto be done, Asuka.
Wh...what was that?
Hey, you two cut it out.
Isn’t that what you said, Misato?\N“You are Number One!”
Well, that was...
And combat is a man’s job, after all.
Talk about out of date!
Unit 02 will back him up.
Unit 00 will back him up as well.
I can’t believe those kids are doing\Nthis without my orders.
Shinji’s getting more manly, isn’t he?
No, I’m going to have to chew him\Nout when he gets back.
You might just be a good teacher.
Ayanami, Asuka, are you in position yet?
Not yet.
You know an Eva can’t move that fast.
Not there yet?
It disappeared!
What?!
Pattern Blue!!  Angel confirmed!\NDirectly beneath Unit 01!
A... a shadow?!
What is this?!  I can’t believe it!!
Shinji, get out of there!  Shinji?!
Ikari?
You idiot!  What are you doing?!
Misato, what’s going on?!
Misato?  Asuka!  Ayanami!  Help me!
Misato?!  Can you hear me, Misato?!\NMisato!!
No response!  It’s not working!
Misato!  Misato!
Shinji!
Asuka!  Rei!  Rescue Unit 01!  Hurry!
That idiot.  He can get an A on a test\Nbut not in the real world.
It disappeared again!
Asuka, be careful.
A shadow?
The city is sinking!
Asuka!  Rei!  Pull back!
B...
Unit 01 and Ikari are still in there.
This is an order.  Retreat.
Major Katsuragi must feel awful.
They reeled the umbilical cable back in,\Nbut the other end was missing.
Without power...
There’s not much energy\Nin the internal batteries.
If Shinji doesn’t waste it groping\Nblindly in the dark...
...if he stays in the most minimal\Nlife-support mode...
...then he can survive for 16 hours.
Second Tank Battalion deployed.
Roger.  Hold your current\Npositions and stand by.
Sub laser circuit has been opened.\NTransmitting data now.
Confirmed.  New line transmitting data.
The UN forces have completely\Nsurrounded it.
Shadow status?
It hasn’t moved.  It stopped\Nspreading once it reached a diameter\Njust over 600 meters.
By the way, is there a use for\Nthose ground troops?
They’re supposed to allow us\Nto apply pressure.
Oh, well...
Taking matters into his own hands,\Ndefying Operations.  He got what\Nhe was asking for.
Just because he got a little better score\Nthan mine, he had to go and show me\Nhow it ought to be done.
What a dummkopf!
What?  Are my comments about\NShinji pissing you off?
Do you pilot Eva just for\Nthe praise of others?
No!  I don’t need anybody’s\Napproval but my own!
Cut it out, you two!
Yes, he acted arbitrarily and\Nwithout consultation.
So...  I’ll just have to punish him\Nwhen he comes back.
I never thought sleeping could\Nbe this exhausting.
Still nothing but white noise...
No radar or sonar reflections at all.\NThis space must be too big.
It’s been 12 hours since I switched\Nto life-support mode.
My life will end in four or five hours.
I’m hungry.
So, that shadow is actually\Nthe Angel’s body?
Correct.  It’s 680 meters in diameter with\Na thickness of three nanometers.
Sustained within that ultra-thin space\Nis an inverted AT Field.
Inside that field is a region of space\Nthat can only be defined by abstract\Nmathematics, a Sea of Dirac.
It could be connected\Nto another universe.
What about the sphere?
It disappears when the imaginary\Ncircuit of the body closes.
The object in the sky is only a shadow.
So the black shadow that swallowed\NUnit 01 is the real target.
Then there’s no way that we can fight it.
The water is getting cloudy!
The purification system is breaking down.
It smells in here...
Blood!  This place smells like blood!
No!  I hate this place!
Why can’t I open this lock?
Open up!  Let me out!
Misato, tell me what’s going on!
Misato!  Asuka!  Ayanami!
Dr. Ritsuko!
Father...
Please...  someone help me.
A forced Eva salvage?
It’s the only possibility that might work.
We would drop all 992 existing\NN2 mines into its center...
...while simultaneously activating the\NAT Fields of both remaining Evas...
...in such a way as to disrupt the\Nhypothetical circuit that encloses the\NAngel’s pocket interior.
If we concentrate enough explosive\Npower into the same microsecond...
...we might destroy the Angel along with\Nthe Dirac Sea that makes up its body.
But the damage to the Eva would be...\NShinji wouldn’t...
What kind of rescue operation is this?
This operation’s priority is to\Nrecover the Eva itself.
That the body may be severely damaged\Nor destroyed in the process\Nhas no bearing.
Now wait a second!
The pilot’s life is not our concern.
If Shinji’s lost, it’s your fault!\NJust remember that!
Why are you and Commander Ikari\Nso worried about Unit 01?
What in the hell is an Eva?
I’ve given you all the information.
You’re lying!
Misato, trust me.
I’m taking command of\Nthis entire operation.
Forward all flights to Kansai International\NAirport.  Contact Air Traffic Control and\Nthe air transport divisions of the JADF.
Who’s that?
Who?
Shinji Ikari.
That’s me.
I am you.\NThis self incorporates another self.
The self has always been composed\Nof two selves.
Two?
Yes, the self which is observed and the\Nself which observes itself.
To expound, the Shinji Ikari that exists in\Nyour mind is only one Shinji Ikari...
...there’s also the Shinji Ikari in\NMisato Katsuragi’s mind...
...the Shinji Ikari in\NAsuka Soryu’s mind...
...the Shinji Ikari in Rei Ayanami’s mind...
...and the Shinji Ikari in\NGendo Ikari’s mind.
All are different Shinji Ikaris...
...but each of them is a true Shinji Ikari.
What you fear are the Shinji Ikaris who\Nexist in the minds of others.
I’m just afraid of being hated.
You’re afraid of being hurt.
Who is bad?
Father is.
The father who deserted us.
No, I’m the one who’s bad.
You’re always apologizing!  Do you\Nalways think you’re the one at fault?
I’m worthless.
No, you just believe that\Nyou’re worthless.
Don’t you trust your father?
I thought I hated my father,\Nbut now I’m not sure...
Good work, Shinji.
My father called me by my name.\NI was praised by my father!
Will you spend your life regurgitating\Nand re-digesting those few\Npleasant memories?
If I trust their words,\Nit’s enough to keep me alive.
Even though you know you’re\Ndeceiving yourself?
Everybody does it!\NThat’s how everyone survives!
If you will not believe that you can change\Nyourself, you will be unable to continue.
This world is filled with too much pain\Nand suffering to keep going on.
For example, you can’t swim.
Humans aren’t made to float.
That is self-deception.
I don’t care what you want to call it.
You have been shutting your eyes and\Nears to that which you wished to avoid.
His sister was injured during the incident.
Who cares what the others say?!
Go away!
No!  I don’t want to hear this!!
See?  You’re running from reality again.
No one can justify their existence\Nby linking their happiest moments into\Na kind of rosary.
In particular, I cannot.
I’ve found something I can do to feel\Ngood.  Something I want to do!
What’s wrong with that?!
In theory, the entry plug’s energy reserves\Nshould be reaching their expiration point.
The plug suit’s life support system will\Nbe getting close to redline.
Advance the schedule by 12 minutes.
Let’s do it while there’s a possibility\Nthat Shinji’s still alive.
Father, am I unwanted?
Father!
It was really yourself that\Nyou ran away from.
That’s right!  He may be guilty\Nof killing his own wife.
He killed his own wife.
No!  Mother was...
...smiling.
You did a good job.
Shinji, you must not run away.
Do your best.
I hate this place!
I hate this loneliness.
No...
The heating and the oxygen circulation\Nare already out.
I’m cold.
It’s useless, the suit is giving out, too.
This is the end...
...tired of...
...everything.
Mother?
Is this enough?
Well, that’s good for you.
Evas are in position and standing by.
AT Fields are ready to generate.
Roger.
T-minus 60 seconds to mine drop.
What’s going on?
Status report!
Unknown!
All meters and gauges are\Ngoing off the scale!
But we haven’t done anything yet!
No way!  Shinji?
It’s impossible!
Unit 01’s power level has to be at zero!
I...  am I piloting a thing like that?
My God, what kind of monster\Nhave we copied from?
Shinji?!  Shinji?!  Shinji?!
Shinji?!  Are you all right, Shinji?!
I just wanted to see them again.
Didn’t you say you were going\Nto punish him?
I’ve never seen the Eva looking as\Nhorrible as it did today.
Are the Evas really on our side?
They may hate us.
I think Major Katsuragi\Nnoticed something.
I see.  Let her be for now.
If Rei or Shinji were to find out the Evas’\Nsecrets, they’d never forgive us.
You can just rest today.\NWe’ll take care of everything.
But I’m fine now.
Well, that’s good for you.
It still smells like blood.
Eva Unit 04, which was being built in\NAmerica, vanishes with NERV’s Second\NBranch during its activation experiment.
Commander Ikari remains silent in the\Nface of this unexpected incident.
SEELE’s old men try to adjust the script...
...and the Fourth Child is selected\Non the basis of a vague feeling.
It’s the next episode, “The Fourth Child.”
I’ll give you more fan service, too!
Like an angel that has no\Nsense of mercy...
Rise, young boy, to the heavens\Nlike a legend.
Cold winds, as blue as the sea,
Tear open the door to\Nyour heart, I see.
But unknowing you seem, just\Nstaring at me...
Standing there smiling serenely.
Desperate, for something to touch...
A moment of kindness like\Nthat in a dream.
Your innocent eyes, have yet no idea...
Of the path your destiny will follow.
But someday you’ll become aware of...
Everything that you’ve got behind you.
Your wings are for seeking out a new...
Future that only you can search for.
The cruel angel’s thesis enters through\Nthe window of your soul.
If you should betray the chapel\Nof your memories.
The cruel angel’s thesis bleeds through\Na portal like your pulsing blood.
So, boy, stand tall and embrace\Nthe fire of the legend,
Embracing the universe like\Na blazing star!
Are you refusing to allow us to question\Nthe pilot of Unit 01, the only one directly\Ninvolved in the incident, Major Katsuragi?
Yes, sir.
Because he is emotionally very unstable...
...I believe that it would be unwise\Nto have him here.
Then, as his proxy, let us ask you,\NMajor Katsuragi.
In this incident, didn’t the Angel attempt\Nto communicate with a human being?
I find no suggestion of that\Nin the subject’s report.
I believe this was an irregularity,\Na coincidence.
If, and only if, his memory is correct.
There is no evidence that his memory\Nhas been tampered with.
However, the Eva’s AC recorder was not\Nfunctioning.  There’s no way to confirm it.
Was the Angel interested in the\Nhuman spirit?  In the human mind?
I am unable to answer that question.
Whether the Angels even have a\Nconcept of what “mind” is...
...or whether they can understand\Nhuman thoughts or not...
...is completely unknown.
A new factor has been added with\Nthis incident, in that the Angel\Ntried to take Eva into itself.
Is there any possibility that this\Naspect may be linked to the predicted\NThirteenth Angel and all Angels thereafter?
Based on the previous patterns, there\Nwould appear to be no systematic\Norganization among the Angels.
That is correct!  It is indeed obvious that\Nthey have worked independently, so far.
What do you mean, sir?
You are not allowed to ask questions.
Understood.
That will be all.  Dismissed.
Yes, sir.
What do you think, Ikari?
The Angels appear to be getting\Nmore and more intelligent.
There’s not much time left.
Left for us, you mean?
Who’s the patient in Room 12?
That’s the emergency room patient\Nfrom the first Eva incident.\NShe’s been here for a long time.
Her injuries were very severe, poor girl.
She’s still in elementary school.
He’s here again today?
Yeah, he comes to see her\Nat least twice a week.
He’s a good brother,\Nthinking about his sister like that.
Yeah, boys like that are pretty rare.
He has a good heart.
Rei, are you all right today?
Yes, sir.  I will be with Dr. Akagi tomorrow.
And the day after I’ll be at school.
How is school?
No problems, sir.
I see.  That’s good.
Stand up!  Bow!  Sit down!
Let me see, Ayanami is absent\Nas usual, and Aida, too?
What’s up with Kensuke?
Mister Suzuhara.
Y...yes, sir!!
Will you deliver this document to\NMiss Ayanami after school?
Yes, sir!
Don’t worry, First Branch is okay.
The data from the recon plane will\Nbe confirmed by the MAGI.
It disappeared?!
The entire Second Branch just vanished?!
Yes, sir.  It’s been confirmed.
It’s gone.
Dear God...
The Administrative and Investigative\Nsections are going crazy...
...and General Affairs is in a total panic.
What was the cause?
It’s still under investigation.
Our only clues are these recon photos\Nfrom the geosynchronous satellite.\NThere’s nothing else left.
10 seconds...
8...
7...
6...
5...

Contact.
This is horrible.
Evangelion Unit 04, its support group and\Nall other facilities within an 89 km radius\Nwere completely destroyed.
Along with thousands of people.
Looking at the time schedule...
...it would appear that they were in\Nthe middle of installing the experimental\NS2 engine from Germany.
Potential causes range from insufficient\Nstructural integrity to a calculation error\Nduring the preliminary design stage.
That’s 32,768 possibilities right there.
And that’s not mentioning sabotage.
But it wasn’t an explosion, was it?
It was a “disappearance.”
In all probability, they were swallowed by\Na Sea of Dirac, just like Unit 01 was.
And the restored S2 engine?
Gone.  Along with our hopes.
It’s all because we’re being forced to use\Nthings that we don’t really understand.
What’ll we do with Unit 03?
We’ll receive it here.
The US government doesn’t want to\Nlose the First Branch as well.
Didn’t they insist on the right to\Nbuild Units 03 and 04?
And now they’re foisting it off on us?\NThey’re really pushing their luck.
After a disaster like that,\Nanyone would get nervous.
And how are you going to\Ndo the test activation?
Will you use Rei’s dummy plug?
I’ll have to make a decision.
This is the dummy plug prototype.
Rei’s personal data has\Nbeen loaded into it...
...but it’s not really possible to digitize\Na human mind and soul.
A fake, that’s all it is.
It copies a pilot’s thinking process.\NIn the end, it’s only a machine.
It transmits a signal pattern to Eva...
...and Eva believes that there is a pilot\Nand synchronizes.  That’s good enough.
Load the data into Unit 01 and Unit 02.
There are still some problems with it.
That’s not important.  As long as the\NEva activates, it’s sufficient.
Understood.
I’ve delegated the transportation\Nof the unit to the UN.
It will arrive by the end of the weekend.
You’ll take care of it from there.
Yes, sir.
We’ll perform the modifications and\Nactivation test in Matsushiro.
And the test pilot will be...
Use of the dummy plug is not\Nrecommended at this time.
One of our prospective candidates...
...will be chosen as the Fourth Child?
Yes.
There is one child whose core can\Nbe prepared immediately.
Then, I’ll trust you to make it so.
Yes, sir.
Rei, we’re finished now.
Yes, sir.
Let’s eat.
Yes, sir.
Stand up!  Bow!
Lunch time!  Lunch time!\NThis is the single best thing about school.
You didn’t make lunches for us?!
I didn’t have time to cook last night.\NI had too much homework.
And that’s your excuse for me having\Nto go without lunch?!
A husband and wife quarrel?
It’s not like that!!
What is it?  You look so serious.
It’s the Unit 03 activation test.
We’ll be using the Fourth as the pilot.
The Fourth?
The Fourth Child’s been found?
Just yesterday.
But I haven’t received a report from\Nthe Marduk Institute yet.
The official documents will be\Ndelivered tomorrow.
Dr. Akagi, are you hiding something\Nfrom me again?
No, nothing at all.
Well, okay.  So, who’s the kid?
Christ!  It’s HIM?!
It can’t be helped.
All of the prospective candidates have\Nbeen gathered together to protect them.
It’s so hard to tell them.
Asuka will be fine.\NShe’s committed to piloting an Eva.
Rei is exceptional...
...with no problems with her Eva\Nor our work.
Shinji probably knows the most\Nabout the down side.
I don’t want him to suffer\Nany more hardships.
But we need children of this kind...
...in order for us all to survive.
Are you saying not to\Ncomplicate the issue?
Bye!  Later!  See ya!
Suzuhara!  You’ve got the duty\Nthis week, get to work!
What do you mean?
The class printout!
Didn’t our teacher tell you to deliver this?!
Come on, Class Rep, you can ask the\Nother person on duty, can’t you?
Miss Ayanami is absent today!
Ayanami and me?
Then I guess there’s no choice.
But I don’t want to go to some\Ngirl’s place all by myself.
Well, I can go with you...
Shinji!
Walk home with me, will you?
Ayanami!
We’re coming in.
You can’t enter a girl’s room\Nwithout her permission!
We’ve got no choice.
She won’t see it if we leave it there.
Excuse us...
My God!
Is this a girl’s room?  It’s so decrepit.
Hey!  You shouldn’t touch anything!\NShe’ll get pissed!
I’m just cleaning up.
I won’t help you!
That’s not a man’s job!
Okay, but Misato hates guys like that.
I don’t care!  It’s my policy!
Come to think of it, you’ve changed.
What?
You, Shinji.
The first time I saw you,\NI really thought you were a jerk.
You didn’t seem like someone who’d\Ndo something for someone else.
I guess you’re just really reserved.
Excuse us!
What?
Those are the school bulletins\Nthat have piled up.
I’m sorry.
I took it upon myself to clean up a little.\NBut I didn’t touch anything except trash.
Th...thank you.
Eva pilots are sure weird all right.
Thank you...
Words of gratitude...
Words I’ve never used...
Not even to him...
The city, a paradise made by mankind.
Driven from Paradise...
...man escaped to this earthly existence,\Non the edge of death.
Created by the weakest of beings...
...created by the sapience born from that\Nweakness, this paradise is our creation.
To protect ourselves from the fear\Nthat death instills...
...to satiate our beings with pleasure...
...we create a paradise by\Nand of ourselves.
This city surely is such a paradise.\NA city armed to protect us.
A city for those who run in fear from the\Noutside world, the world of our enemies.
But cowards do live longer.
That’s to our benefit.
The third New Tokyo,\NNERV’s hidden intercept base...
...the long delayed seventh construction\Nphase will soon be finished.
At long last, it will be completed.
Unit 04’s “accident,” how will you\Nreport it to the committee?
With the facts, the cause is unknown.
But this is a major, catastrophic loss.
Unit 04 and the Second Branch\Nare of no consequence.
The S2 engine prototype may have\Nbeen lost, but the data is still on\Nrecord in Germany.
This installation and Unit 01\Nwill be sufficient.
But the committee is in a panic.
Of course, it was an\Nunscheduled accident.
SEELE must be busy changing\Nthe schedule.
Incidents not depicted in the\NDead Sea Scrolls may occur.
This ought to teach the old men a lesson.
The intercept system is completed...\N\N\N\N\N
NERV is the most inflexible organization.\N\N\N\N\N
It’s because of Commander Ikari.
And are you a prude, too?
Are you serious, Mr. Kaji?
I’ll tell Miss Katsuragi and Dr. Akagi.
Not if your mouth is covered with mine...
So, how’s it going?
Well, it’s going, I guess.
Well, I have work to do.  Excuse me.
Far be it from me to make judgments\Non your private life...
...but under these circumstances should\Nyou be hitting on girls in this organization?
Who’s under whom isn’t your concern.
Or would you prefer I hit\Non you, Katsuragi?
It depends on how you\Nanswer my questions.
You know the secrets behind the\NMarduk Institute and that Adam thing\Ndown there, don’t you?
What secrets?
Don’t try to feign ignorance!
Asking for help isn’t like you.
You know, at the moment I don’t care,\NI’m not feeling very reserved.
The Fourth Child was conveniently\Nfound at just the right time.\NWhat’s the truth behind that?
I’ll tell you one thing.
The Marduk Institute doesn’t exist.\NNERV is pulling the strings all by itself.
NERV itself?
Commander Ikari is?
You need to check Code 707.
Code 707?
Shinji’s school?
Misato!
What is it?
Ritsuko says she’s expecting you for a\Nmeeting about tomorrow’s business trip.
All right.  Thank you.
See ya.
Yeah, yeah.
Buy you a drink?  Cup of tea?
But...  I’m a boy.
I thought you’d be a more\Nserious person, Kaji.
You’re saying that to someone as arrow\Nstraight and reliable as me, Shinji Ikari?
I...I’m sorry.
I’m sorry, too.\NI didn’t mean to sound rude.
Hey, I want to show you something.
Watermelons?
Yeah, aren’t they cute?  This is my hobby.
Keep it a secret, okay?
Growing...  making something\Ngrow is really great.
One can see and learn so many\Nthings from the process.
It also brings pleasure.
But pain, too, right?
Do you hate pain?
I don’t like it.
But have you found what\Ngives you pleasure?
That’s not so bad.
If you’ve known pain and hardship,\Nit’s easier to be kind to others.
Being kind isn’t a weakness.
Yes?  Hello?
It’s Katsuragi.
The synch test will be starting soon.
The pilot will be officially\Ninformed tomorrow.\N\N\N
Stand up!  Attention!  Bow!
Toji Suzuhara...\NReport to the Principal’s Office.
What the...
What did you do?
I don’t know.
Excuse me, I’m Toji Suzuhara.
You’re Toji Suzuhara?
How was your trip to New Yokosuka?
Way cool!
Speaking of which, I picked up\Nsome disturbing information.
Eva Unit 03?
Yeah, the one they built in America.\NIt’s completed, isn’t it?
I don’t know.
I know it’s classified,\Nbut please tell me something!
I really don’t know!
Haven’t you heard the rumor that the\Nactivation test will be held at the second\Ntest facility in Matsushiro?
I haven’t.
The pilot hasn’t been chosen yet, right?
How would I know?
Misato could pick me for it.
Shinji, would you ask her for me?\NI really want to be an Eva pilot!!
Really, I don’t know.
What about the story that\NUnit 04’s been lost?
What was that?
You really don’t know?
It disappeared along with the\Nentire Second Branch.
My dad’s section was in a panic.
Really?
I think so.
Misato didn’t tell me anything.
Well, I guess it doesn’t directly\Nconcern the pilots.
If she didn’t tell you, it’s probably because\Nyou don’t need to know.
I’m sorry about bothering you\Nwith weird questions.
But Toji hasn’t come back yet...
Thus, we, mankind, survived the hell\Ncalled the Second Impact and rose again.
The number of children has been\Ndecreasing yearly...
Sorry I’m late.
I know about it.  Be seated.
Anyway, it is you, the younger\Ngenerations, who will lead the\Nway to the future...
Let’s go home.
What about Toji?
He’ll be late.
He’s got class duty.
The school is now closing.  All students\Nmust go to their homes immediately.
Suzuhara!
You’re on duty.
Line up the desks and write up\Nthe daily record!
I haven’t had lunch yet.\NI’ll do it as soon as I’ve eaten.
Suzuhara, you always buy your lunch\Nfrom the school shop.
That’s because there’s no one\Nwho cooks for me.
Suzuhara...
I have two sisters.  Their names\Nare Kodama and Nozomi...
...and I always cook lunch for them.
That must be a lot of work.
So, I’m actually a good cook,\Nthough you might not think it.
Really?
And I always end up cooking\Ntoo much for our lunches.
That’s a waste...
If you need help getting rid of\Nyour leftovers, I’ll help.
Yes, help me.
Kaji?
Oh, Asuka?  Sorry, I’m busy right now.\NCan it wait?
But you have time to\Nsee Misato, don’t you?
Damn it!  Not right now!
These are our synch data reports.
Four of them?
What in the hell is this?
Who made HIM the Fourth Child?
No!  I don’t understand!  What is this?!
Eva Unit 03 is delivered\Nto Matsushiro from America.
People glory in the last peaceful day,\Nunaware of the coming tragedy.
On that day, all eyes will be focused\Non the children’s tragedy.
The quiet days that collusion has\Ncamouflaged are gone...
...and Misato’s heart is filled with the\Nsound of Shinji screaming.
It’s the next episode,\N“The Judgment of Life.”
And I’ll give you lots of fan service again!

This is Ecta 64 calling Neo Path 400...
...confirm cumulonimbus clouds in your\Nimmediate flight path, over.
This is Neo Path 400...
...cumulonimbus clouds confirmed.
Barometer indicates no hazard.
Will maintain course...
...expect to arrive on schedule.
This is Ecta 64, roger and out.
Where’s Asuka?
She’s already left.  It would seem that\Nshe doesn’t want to face me.
But why?
Shinji, sometimes a woman’s heart is\Ntoo difficult to understand.
Go ahead.
Is the rumor that Unit 04\Ndisappeared true?
I heard that there was some kind\Nof accident, and it exploded.
Yes, it’s true.
Unit 04 is gone, along with the\NSecond Branch of NERV.
It happened while they were\Ntesting the S2 engine.
But don’t worry, we’ll be all right.\NAll three of our Evas are\Nfunctioning properly.
And our pilots and staff are\Nin good shape, too.
I heard that Unit 03 is being brought\Nhere from America.
You’re performing the activation tests\Nat Matsushiro, aren’t you?
I’ll be out for four days or so,\Nbut Kaji will be taking care of you two,\Nso don’t worry.
But what about the test?
Ritsuko will be supervising everything.\NThere won’t be any problems.
And what about the pilot?!
Well, about the pilot...
Yes?
Good morning!
I’ve come to ask you for your help,\NMajor Katsuragi!
Please!  Make me the pilot for\NEvangelion Unit 03!!
So, Shinji still doesn’t know yet?
I just can’t find a chance to tell him.
I’m worried.
I just can’t figure out what\Nhe’s thinking about.
Pull yourself together.
You’re the one who wanted\Nto be his guardian.
I know you’re right, but...
When will you be acquiring the pilot?
Well, tomorrow.  There are still some\Nthings that have to be arranged.
Still, the new pilot might tell Shinji himself.
I don’t think so.
He wasn’t enthused enough\Nto be bragging about it.
He was only willing to accept under the\Ncondition that his sister be transferred to\Nour hospital here at headquarters.
How can Misato be this cruel?
I’m eager to be a pilot so she could at\Nleast use me as a backup pilot.
Right, Toji?
What’s up?  You left before me,\Nbut you’re late.
What, no fight between the\Nnewlyweds today?
I just didn’t want to see your ugly faces!!
You three damn stooges!!
Ah, the precious moment of lunch time!\NHey, where’s Toji?
He’s gone.
Gone?  Without his lunch?  Him?
That’s impossible!!
He’s been acting odd lately.
Suzuhara...
Oh, Ayanami, if you’re looking\Nfor Shinji, he isn’t here.
You know about it, don’t you?
And Soryu knows about it,\Ntoo, doesn’t she?
So Shinji’s the only one\Nwho doesn’t know.
You know, it’s pretty rare for you to be\Nconcerned about someone else.
Really?  I’m not sure I understand.
You care about Shinji.
Do I?
Maybe that’s true.
Yeah, you do.
Hikari!
Let’s have lunch together!
Two hours late, and then,\Nfinally, he arrives.
He’s the first guy to ever make\Nme wait this long.
Yeah, because you usually didn’t wait for\Nthe guy when you were dating.
This was the so called Second Impact.
At that time I was living in a\Nplace called Nebukawa...
...but the rising water levels caused by\Nthe melting of Antarctica...
...have buried it beneath the sea.
Sorry, newcomer, but I\Nhad to clobber you!
I had to hit you, or I wouldn’t\Nhave been satisfied.
I’m sorry, Asuka.\NYou always walk home with Ikari.
Forget it.  The only reason I’m with\NShinji is because of my work.
And right now I don’t feel\Nlike looking at him.
This is about Suzuhara, isn’t it?
Yes.  How did you know?
It’s pretty obvious.  The three stooges\Nare the only ones who can’t see it.
Ikari seems naive.
Actually, he’s just a dolt.
He’s an idiot, too.  He hasn’t got any idea\Nas to how to relate to others.
Really?
I think Suzuhara might like Ayanami.
Suzuhara?!  He likes that smart ass?!
Well, they seemed to be very\Nsociable during lunch.
Don’t worry, it’ll never happen.
That girl is 10,000 times more dense than\NShinji when it comes to communication!
Really?
Can I ask you one thing?
What?
What do you see in a simple minded\Nstooge like that?
His compassion...
Are you asleep yet, Kaji?
No, not yet.
What’s my father like?
Well, there’s a surprise question.
I thought you’d ask about Katsuragi.
It seems like you’re always\Nwith my father.
Vice-Commander Fuyutsuki is the one\Nwho’s always with him.
Have you been asking around\Nabout your father?
I haven’t been around him much.
So you don’t really know him?
But I’ve learned a lot about him lately.
About his work, about my mother, so...
No, you’re wrong.\NYou only believe that you’ve learned.
The fact is that people really don’t\Nunderstand themselves...
...much less each other.
Understanding one hundred percent\Nof anything is impossible.
That’s why we spend so much time\Ntrying to understand our own motivations\Nand those of others.
That’s what makes life so interesting.
Does that mean that you don’t\Nunderstand Misato either?
The Chinese character that we\NJapanese use for the word “she” literally\Nmeans “a woman far away.”
No matter how hard we try, women\Nwill always be on the distant shore of\Na great gulf of misunderstanding.
The current that separates men\Nand women is broader and deeper\Nthan the ocean itself.
I don’t understand what being\Nan adult must be like.
T-minus 300 minutes to Unit 03\Nactivation test.
Main power supply, no problems.
Second apotheosis is nominal.
Coolant systems are normal.
Repairs to left arm crimp lock completed.
Roger.  Team B, commence operation.
No problems detected in the\Ndata link to Unit 01.
It’s ready enough for combat duty now.
Well, how nice for you.
Now that was a half-hearted reply.
Are you aware that this unit will be\Nassigned to you once it’s passed its tests?
The exclusive control of four Evas...
If you wanted to,\Nyou could destroy the world.
Have you told Shinji yet?
I’ll tell him when this test is over.
The Fourth Child has arrived.
2nd Squad, begin readying the\Nentry vehicle immediately.
He’s not here yet, Asuka.
He may not come today.
I thought we might eat together today...
Do you want this?
Unit 03’s already in Japan, isn’t it?
Yeah, it got here yesterday.
I knew it.  Who’s gonna pilot it?
Toji maybe?  He’s absent today,\Nso maybe it’s him.
No way!
Entry plug repairs completed.
Initiating first connection.
Transmitting pulse.
Graph readout is normal.
All checklists up to 1350\Nhave been cleared.
No problems found in\Ninitial contact phase.
Roger.  Shift the operation to phase two.
All nerve links are normal.
All checklists up to 2550\Nhave been cleared.
Harmonics are normal.
We are now exceeding\Nthe absolute border.
Abort the test!  Break the circuit!
No!  Mission failure!!  High energy\Nreadings detected in the body!!
Impossible!
An Angel?!
An explosion has occurred in Matsushiro!
Damage level unknown!
Send the rescue squad\Nand the 3rd Troop.
Take care of it before the\NSSDF gets involved.
Roger.
Movement of an unidentified object\Ndetected at the site.
Wavelength pattern is orange.\NIt’s not confirmed as an Angel.
Go to first stage alert.
All personnel go to first stage alert!
Prepare for ground combat!
Launch all Evas!
Disperse in the maximum intercept zone!
Air transport is scheduled to go in 20.
An accident in Matsushiro?!
No way...  What happened to Misato?
Contact hasn’t been restored yet.
But, then, what will we do?
Stop whining!  There’s nothing\Nelse we can do now!
But how can we fight the\NAngel by ourselves?
Commander Ikari will take\Ncommand now.
My father will...
The target’s image has been captured at\NMt. Nobe.  Transferring to main monitor.
As I thought...
Transmit the abort signal.
Force eject the entry plug.
It’s not working.  Neither the abort\Nsignal nor the plug ejection code\Nwere accepted.
What about the pilot?
He’s still breathing and his heart’s\Nbeating, but probably...
Abandon Evangelion Unit 03 at this time.\NList it as the Thirteenth Angel.
But...
Disperse the battle line at Mt. Nobe\Nas planned.  Destroy the target.
Target is approaching!
All units prepare for ground combat!
No way!
Is this an Angel?!
Correct.  This is the target.
You said that this is the target...
...but this is an Eva, isn’t it?!
But that’s...
How could it have been possessed\Nby an Angel?
Is it piloted by a human, too,\Na child like us?
You still don’t know?!\NThe pilot of Unit 03 is...
Asuka?
Asuka?!
Eva Unit 02 has gone silent!
The pilot has ejected.\NRecovery squad is heading for retrieval.
Target is moving towards Unit 00!
Rei, avoid close range combat\Nand stop the target.
I’m sending Unit 01 in now.
Roger.
The Angel is invading Unit 00’s left arm!
The nerv systems are being corrupted!
Cut off the left arm.  Immediately!
But you’ve got to sever the\Nneural connection first!
Cut it off!
Yes, sir.
Unit 00 is severely damaged.\NThe pilot is wounded.
No way...
The target is approaching you!\NIt will reach you in T-minus 20.\NYou must destroy it!
But this target is...
...operated by a person, isn’t it?
Another child my own age?
An entry plug!
There is a person in there,\Njust as I thought.
Life support is breaking down!
The pilot’s life is in danger!!
No!  Cut the synch ratio to 60%!
Wait!
But Ikari, the pilot could be killed!
Shinji, why don’t you fight?
There’s a person in there, Father!
Irrelevant!  It is an Angel!  Our enemy!!
But...  but I can’t!
I must help him!  I can’t kill!
If you don’t, you will die!!
I’d rather die!!
Cut all synchronization between the\Npilot and Unit 01.  Do it now!!
Cut it?
Correct!  Switch the control circuit\Nto the dummy plug!
The dummy plug still doesn’t function\Nproperly.  Without Dr. Akagi’s approval...
It’s still better than the pilot.  Do it!
Yes, sir.
What is this?
What in the hell are you doing, Father?!
Signal acknowledgment, confirmed.
Control system switching is complete.
All nerves linked to the dummy system.
32.8% of the Emotional Elements are\Nunclear.  It can’t be monitored.
Irrelevant.  Open the system.\NBegin the attack.
Is this the power of the dummy plug?
System status nominal!
Gain still increasing!
Stop this!
Father, no!  Stop doing this now!
Damn it!  Stop!
Stop it!  Stop it!  Stop it!\NStop it!  Stop it!
Stop!
Stop!
E...Eva Unit 03, no, I mean...
...the target is completely silent.
How about if I cook this?  Kodama,\NNozomi and I...  this recipe is for four.
I sure hope he’s going to eat tomorrow.
Am I still alive?\N\N\N
Where’s Ritsuko?\N\N\N\N\N
I...  I haven’t told Shinji anything.\N\N\N
Shinji...
Misato, so you’re safe?
I...
I’m sorry.  I had something important\Nto tell you, but...  I’m sorry...
Misato, I...
...I killed...
My father forced me to...
...I begged him, but...
Shinji, I’m sorry.  I’m sorry.
Report from the entry plug recovery team.\NThe pilot’s life signs are confirmed.
He’s alive?!
The Fourth Child is...
Toji?
Shinji?
Shinji?!
Shinji?!
On his own, Shinji makes the decision\Nto quit his position as a pilot.
Misato can find no words to\Nheal the boy’s heart.
Once again, the separation begins.
When the strongest Angel yet attacks,\Nhowever, regardless of how he feels...
...Shinji believes that he has brought\Nanother tragedy.
Watching the Angel destroy Units 02\Nand 00, Shinji Ikari makes his decision.
It’s the next episode, “A Man’s Fight.”
Like an angel that has no\Nsense of mercy...
Rise, young boy, to the heavens\Nlike a legend.
Cold winds, as blue as the sea,
Tear open the door to\Nyour heart, I see.
But unknowing you seem, just\Nstaring at me...
Standing there smiling serenely.
Desperate, for something to touch...
A moment of kindness like\Nthat in a dream.
Your innocent eyes, have yet no idea...
Of the path your destiny will follow.
But someday you’ll become aware of...
Everything that you’ve got behind you.
Your wings are for seeking out a new...
Future that only you can search for.
The cruel angel’s thesis enters through\Nthe window of your soul.
If you should betray the chapel\Nof your memories.
The cruel angel’s thesis bleeds through\Na portal like your pulsing blood.
So, boy, stand tall and embrace\Nthe fire of the legend,
Embracing the universe like\Na blazing star!
Unit 01’s interlock circuit has been cut.
What about the force eject signal?
It’s being blocked from the plug side.\NIt’s not being accepted.
But, Shinji, if we hadn’t done that\Nyou would have been killed.
That’s not the point.
But it is a fact.
Don’t push me anymore!
Unit 01 has 185 seconds of power\Nleft in its reserves.
That’s enough to destroy at least\Nhalf of headquarters.
The way he is right now,\Nhe’ll do it too.
Shinji, listen to us!
If Commander Ikari hadn’t made\Nthat decision, everyone could\Nhave been killed!
I said that’s not the point!!
My father...
...tried to kill Toji using my hands!
That bastard!
Father, you’re there, aren’t you?!\NSay something!  Answer me!
Increase the pressure of the\NLCL to maximum.
We have no time to waste\Non a petulant child.
I’ve still got a direct control circuit...
Damn...  damn...
Damn...
The right breast has been\Ncompletely dissolved.
We’ll begin cleansing the bodily\Nfluids from 03 on schedule.
Have you recovered?
I can work.
I couldn’t just lie in bed during\Nan emergency like this.
So what happened to Shinji?
I understand that they opened\Nthe escape hatch with a laser cutter\Nand removed him forcibly.
This sucks.
This time...
...he’s really finished.
That idiot won’t find a\Nway out this time.
How is Ikari?
He wasn’t injured,\Nso he ought to be okay.
He’s probably dreaming away.
Dreaming?
Yeah.  Don’t tell me you don’t dream?
Shinji...
Why is he lying here next to me?
Where am I?
In the same hospital where\Nmy sister is, maybe?
Hey, isn’t that Shinji and Ayanami?
Ikari, why did you do that?
Because I couldn’t forgive my father.
He betrayed me.
Even though I was finally\Nable to talk to him...
...he doesn’t understand me at all!!
Did you try to understand\Nyour father’s feelings?
I did.
Why don’t you try to understand him?
I said I did!
You’re running away from\Nunpleasant truths.
Why not?!  What’s wrong with running\Naway from reality if it sucks?
What are those two arguing about?
This is an exception.\NYou’ve got five minutes.
Thank you.
If it isn’t the class rep...
Suzuhara, are you okay?
Well, I’m still alive.
I thought Shinji was here, though.\NWas that just a dream?
Ikari was let out yesterday.\NYou’ve slept for three days, Suzuhara.
I did?  For three whole days?
Class Rep, did you...
No, I came here as the class\Nrepresentative!  It’s an official duty!
Yeah, I know that.
You don’t know anything.
I’m sorry...
...that I didn’t get to eat\Nthe lunch you made.
Don’t worry about it.
But I am sorry that I can’t bring you\Na lunch here, it’s not allowed.
Class Rep?
What?
Would you do me a favor?
Would you tell my sister that there’s\Nnothing wrong with me?
Get out, Shinji Ikari.\NThe Commander wants to see you.
Disobeying orders;\Npersonal occupation of an Eva;\Nchildish intimidation...
These are all criminal offenses.
Do you have anything to say?
Yes.  I don’t want to pilot an Eva.\NI don’t want to stay here anymore.
Well then, leave.
Yes.  I’ll go back to my teacher’s place.
So you’re running away again?
You disappoint me.\NI assume that we’ll never meet again.
Yes.  That’s my intent.
It’s me.
Erase the Third Child.
Rei will be Unit 01’s designated pilot,\Nwith the dummy plug as backup.
You there, Shinji?
Is it true that you’re leaving?
It’s true, isn’t it?
But why?  Why are you\Nrunning away again?
I admired you.
I envied you.\NYou’re different from us.
Damn!  Even Toji became an\NEva pilot, while I...
This line is monitored.  For security\Nreasons we have terminated this call.\NWe appreciate your cooperation.
I assume that Asuka is\Ndisgusted with me.
Yes, she didn’t even ask me to\Nsay goodbye to you.
That sounds like her.  That’s good.
It’s going to be hard if you keep\Nhiding your anger like that.
That’s your philosophy, Misato.\NI can’t live like you.
As I’m sure you know, there will\Nbe a lot of restrictions placed\Nupon your activities.
Yes.
But...
What?
Let me ask you one thing.
Why was Toji chosen to be\Nthe Fourth Child?
All your classmates are\NFourth Level candidates.
I just found out myself that\Nit was yet another setup.
All of them?
All of my classmates...
Suzuhara was a mistake that can’t be\Nmended with words alone.
But, Shinji, to be honest,\NI was projecting all of my dreams,\Nhopes and purpose onto you.
I know that it’s been a huge\Nburden for you...
...but we, everyone at NERV,\Nhad no choice except to entrust\Nour future to you.
I want you to remember that.
It’s a selfish cause, isn’t it?
I admit that.
I’ll leave your pass code\Nto headquarters and your room\Nas they are.
What’s the point?  Get rid of them.
I won’t pilot an Eva again.
A special state of emergency has\Nbeen declared for the Tokai region.
All residents must evacuate to their\Ndesignated shelters immediately.
Repeating...
An Angel!
All personnel go to first stage\Nbattle stations.  Prepare for\Nground-to-air intercept.
Target status?
It’s moving into our perimeter.
The Komagatake Defense Line\Nhas been breached.
The first eighteen layers of armor\Nhave been shattered.
Eighteen layers of special armor\Nat once!  Incredible!
The Eva won’t make it there in time\Nfor a ground level intercept.
Position Unit 02 for combat inside\Nthe Geo-Front, directly in front\Nof headquarters.
Asuka will engage the target as soon\Nas it breaks into the Geo-Front.
What about Unit 00?
It’s been placed in the AT Field\NNeutralization Zone.
However, the left arm hasn’t\Nbeen regenerated yet.
Then it’s not ready for combat yet.
Sortie Rei inside Unit 01.
Prepare a dummy plug as\Nthe backup system.
Yes, sir.
Start entry.
Charge LCL.
Commence A10 nerve connection.
Pulse flow is reversing!
Unit 01 is refusing the\Nneural connection!
Is that possible?
Ikari?
Yes, it’s refusing me.
Abort activation, sortie Rei in Unit 00.
Re-activate Unit 01 with\Nthe dummy plug.
But Unit 00 isn’t ready!
It’s not a problem.  I can go.
Rei?!
Hey, you there!  What’re you doing?!\NGet into the shelter, quickly!
It’s no use!
One more hit and the armor will\Nbe completely destroyed!
I’m counting on you, Asuka.
Here it comes.  Even without Shinji,\NI can beat it easily.
Damn you!
Next!!
I’m neutralizing its AT Field, aren’t I?!
Why doesn’t it collapse, damn it?!
I can’t lose again!
No way!
You damn son of a bitch!
Asuka!  Cut all the nerve\Nconnections, now!
Direct hit on the Eighth Block!
Abandon the Sixth Shelter!\NAll survivors, go to the Third Shelter!
Unit 02 is severely damaged!\NIt can’t continue combat!
How’s Asuka?!
She’s safe!  Alive!
Damn it...
The Angel has started moving.
What’s Unit 01’s status?
Dummy plug upload, complete.
Probe insertion, complete.
Start contact.
Roger!
What?
The pulses have vanished!\NIt’s refusing the dummy plug!
It’s no use!\NEva Unit 01 will not activate!
The dummy...  Rei...
...are being refused?
Fuyutsuki, I’m leaving you\Nin charge of this.
Take casualties to the Sixth Block.
Uninjured, go to the Third Shelter!
This way!
Hurry!
Quick!
Hurry!
Hey, you!  What’re you doing?\NDo you wanna die?!
Asuka...
Is that you, Shinji!
Kaji?!
What are you doing here?
That’s my line.
What are you doing here, Shinji?
I...
I decided that I’ll never\Npilot an Eva again.
And since I decided that...
Is that so?
Well, since my other job became\Npublic knowledge...
...I’m off the combat roster.
So, here I am, sprinkling.
At a time like this?
What better time?
Although I’d rather be between\NMisato’s breasts...
...I wouldn’t mind being\Nhere when I die.
Die?
That’s right.
It’s said that if an Angel comes into\Ncontact with Adam, who lies sleeping\Nbeneath this very ground...
...humanity will be eradicated.
The Third Impact.
The only thing that can stop it is\Nthe one thing that has the power equal\Nto an Angel’s, the Evangelion.
Ayanami?
With no rifle?!
Is she trying to blow herself up?!
Rei!
AT Field, full power!
What happened to Unit 00?
Rei!
What has she done?
Shinji, the only thing I can do\Nis stand here and water.
But you, you have something that you\Ncan do.  That only you can do.
Nobody is forcing you.\NThink for yourself and make\Nthe decision by yourself.
Think about what you have to do now.
Think about no longer\Nhaving any regrets.
Direct hit on the third foundation!
The final armor plate has melted!
Damn!  The Main Shaft\Nis completely open!
Isn’t Unit 01 ready yet?
It’s refusing the dummy plug!
It failed.  No response detected!
Keep trying.\NRepeat the process from step 108.
Let me pilot it!!
Me...  me...
Let me pilot Unit 01, please!
Father...
Why are you here?
I...  I...
I am the pilot of Evangelion Unit 01!
I am Shinji Ikari!!
The target has entered the Main Shaft!
It’s descending!
Where is it heading?
It’s advancing directly towards\NCentral Dogma!
It’s coming here?!
All personnel evacuate!  Hurry!
All personnel evacuate!\NRepeat, all personnel evacuate!
Eva Unit 01?!
Shinji?!
Misato!
Launch the fifth catapult!!  Hurry!!
Out of energy?
Unit 01 has drained its reserves!\NThe backup power isn’t working!
Shinji...
Shinji!
Move!  Move!  Move!  Move!\NCome on, move!
Move now or there’s no point to this!
That’s...
Move!  Move!  Move!
Move!  Move!  Move!  Move!\NMove!  Move!
Move!  Move!  Come on, move!!
You’ve got to move!  Move now!\NOr everyone will be killed!
I’m sick of it already!!  So...
...COME ON, MOVE!!
E...Eva has re-activated!
Incredible...
No way, this is unbelievable!\NUnit 01’s synch ratio is over 400%!
Does that mean she’s been awakened?
It’s eating the Angel?
She’s taking the S2 engine\Ninto herself?
Eva Unit 01 is...
The bindings!
Bindings?
That’s right.  It’s not really armor.
Those are restraints that allow us\Nto control the Eva’s power.
But now the Eva is removing the\Nweb that binds it to our will.
We can no longer control the Eva.
Unit 01’s been awakened and set free!
SEELE won’t stay quiet for this.
Did you say this was part of your\Nscenario, Commander Ikari?
It’s begun, hasn’t it?
Yes, this is the beginning.
Mankind has been saved by\Nthe Eva’s awakening...
...but its pilot has been physically\Nfused with the Eva.
Shinji’s fused with another existence.\NWhat will he see?  What will he learn?\NWhat will he lose while inside?
Meanwhile, those who have been left\Nbehind try to salvage him...
...but the attempt fails.
What was it that the crying\NMisato saw?
It’s the next episode,\N“Form of the Mind, Form of the Man.”

It’s eating the Angel?
Those bindings were what allowed us\Nto control the Eva’s power.
But now the Eva is removing the\Nweb that binds it to our will.
Unit 01’s been awakened and set free!
SEELE won’t stay quiet for this.
The Eva series isn’t capable of\Ngenerating S2 organs themselves.
But we never imagined that it would\Nbe able to take one into itself this way.
This incident is at extreme odds with\Nthe scenario SEELE created.
It will not be easy to correct this.
Gendo Ikari...  It was a mistake to\Nentrust NERV to him, wasn’t it?
But he was the only one who could\Nachieve this project’s goals.
Ikari, what’s going on in your mind?
It’s begun, hasn’t it?
Yes, this is the beginning.
Damage on both Evas is over\Nthe Hayflick limit, beyond\Nany normal restoration.
It may be a while before we can\Nrestore everything to normal.
Fortunately, the MAGI system can be\Ntransferred to a new location.
We may be able to start\Nworking tomorrow.
But this place will have\Nto be scrapped.
It’s just a matter of time before the\Nbrass decides to abandon it.
That’s true.
For the time being, we’ll have to use\Nthe Secondary Command Center.
You mean, without the MAGI?
That’s right.
We can clean the dust off and be\Nworking again by this afternoon.
But the chairs are too cramped down\Nthere, and the sensors don’t operate\Nsmoothly.  It’s difficult to work there.
But at least the layout is the same\Nas our original Command Center.
It just feels like we don’t belong there.
At least we have an alternative.
We have no choice when it\Ncomes to using Unit 01.
It may be restrained by the cage,\Nbut are you sure it’s safe?
No heat emissions, free electrons,\Nelectromagnetic fields or chemical\Nreactions are being detected.
The S2 unit is completely inactive.
Nevertheless, on three\Nseparate occasions Unit 01 has\Nmoved without power.
You can’t judge this situation just by\Nthe things you can see and measure.
Yeah, we can’t take any chances,\Nthat’s for sure.
It’s as unpredictable as\Nyou are, Katsuragi.
I’m sorry.
However, our concerns are\Nnot limited to Unit 01.
Correct.  Serious damage was\Nsustained by Units 00 and 02.
Headquarters was partially destroyed,\Nexposing Central Dogma.
The destruction was enormous.
We can’t even estimate how much\Nmoney and time have been lost.
This all is because we didn’t put\Na bell around Ikari’s neck.
A bell was there, but it didn’t ring.
A bell that doesn’t ring\Nserves no purpose.
We’ll make sure the bell\Nworks next time.
My, my, what an unexpected situation!
How will you explain to\Nthe committee...  I mean, how will\Nyou explain this to SEELE?
Unit 01 wasn’t under our control.
This was an accident.
Unit 01 will remain frozen until the\Ncommittee gives us further orders.
That’s a very appropriate decision.
However, isn’t your son\Nstill trapped inside it?
It’s hopeless.  It’s not accepting the\Ncode to eject the entry plug.
What about the backup codes?
Also refused.  Even a direct circuit\Nisn’t getting through.
The plug’s video monitor\Nis active, though.
Switching to main screen.
What in the hell is this?
I’d say that’s the truth behind\Na 400% synch ratio.
I can’t believe it.\NWhat happened to Shinji?
Apparently the Eva has taken\Nhim into itself.
What does that mean?!\NJust what is an Eva?!
It is something created by man in\Nman’s own image.  I really can’t\Ndescribe it any other way.
You didn’t create anything!
You just copied something you\Nfound in the Antarctic!
What was the original?\NThat’s what I want to know, Doctor!
This is not just a copy.\NA human will is inside it.
Are you saying somebody willed\Nthis to happen?
No, the Eva did.
Do something, damn you!
You created this, didn’t you?!\NTake responsibility for it!!
On the issue of the Nansa Islands...
...the government and the Ministry of\NInternal Affairs have announced that\Nthere is no federal involvement.
In other news, it has been a\Nmonth since the terrorist\Nincident in Tokyo-2...
...and the government has announced\Nnew legislation to prevent another...
I know that Wonder Girl is still alive!
Why are you bothering me with trivial\Ncrap like that, Misato?!
I can’t believe it.\NI couldn’t do anything.
I can’t believe that stupid Shinji\Noutperformed me.
Not again!
What do you mean,\Nyou’re going to “salvage” Shinji?
Well, theoretically, Shinji’s life\Nforce still exists in there.
And you’ll be respecting\Nthat life this time?
Losing Shinji is out of\Nthe question now.
I don’t know.
What NERV wants is Unit 01\Nas their tool, not Shinji.
I don’t deny it.
Our assumption is that Shinji’s body\Nlost its Ego border and he’s floating in\Nthe entry plug in quantum form.
You’re saying that Shinji has shifted\Ninto a form we can’t see?
Yes, the LCL has chemically altered\Ninto something very similar to the\Nsea water of primitive Earth.
You mean, like a primordial soup?
All of the substances which composed\NShinji are still preserved in the plug...
...and his soul exists there as well.
In fact, his Ego image is giving a sort\Nof substance to his plug suit.
In other words, this salvage operation\Nmust both reconstruct his body\Nand fix his soul in it.
Is that possible?
With the MAGI’s support, yes.
This is all theoretical, isn’t it?
You won’t know what will really\Nhappen until you do it.
What is this?
Where am I?
In the entry plug?
That’s right.  But there’s nobody here.\NNot even myself.
What is this?  What is this?\NWhat is this?
I don’t understand.
These people...
Yes, they’re people I know.\NPeople who know me.
I understand now.  This is my world.
What is this?
This is supposed to be my world,\Nbut this I don’t understand.
An image from outside?
A hostile image?
That’s right!  The enemy!
Enemy!  Enemy!  Enemy!  Enemy!
Our enemies are something called\NAngels, they have the names\Nof the Angels, too.
They are the targets of\NEva and NERV.
This is our revenge for the\Ndeath of Misato’s father!
Why do I fight?\NDespite all the pain and suffering?
What are you, stupid?
An unknown enemy is attacking us,\Nof course we have to fight them!
Am I odd to try to find\Na reason to fight?
Am I not supposed to think about it?
Enemy!  Enemy!  Enemy!  Enemy!
All are my enemies!
Us...  That which threatens us\Nis the enemy.
Of course, how can I be faulted\Nfor protecting my own life and\Nthose of others?!
Enemy!  Enemy!  Enemy!  Enemy!
My enemy!  My enemy!
Damn it!  Damn it!  Damn it!
You hurt Toji and killed my mother!\NFather!
Why do you hate your father?
Anyone would hate such a father!
You don’t understand him, do you?
Of course not.\NI’ve hardly ever seen him.
Is that why you hate him?
Yes!  My father doesn’t need me!\NMy father deserted me!
And am I his substitute?
Yes!!  It must be so!!
He abandoned me because\Nhe had Ayanami!
As if you didn’t run away\Nall by yourself.
Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!\NIt’s all his fault!!
That time I was actually going\Nto tell him I hate him!
Correct.
That can’t be true!  It can’t be!\NHow can you say that?!
You don’t need me, do you?!
I called you because you had a use.
Why me?
Because there was no one\Nelse who could.
No way, I’ve never seen this before!\NIt’s impossible!!
Yes, I knew it was true.
It’s true!  I knew Eva.
Then I escaped!  I really escaped!\NLeaving my father and mother behind!
The concentration of LCL is\Ncurrently stable at 36%.  No problem\Nwith oxygen concentration.
Electromagnetic radiation pulse is\Nnormal.  Wave pattern is 0.
Counters are functioning normally.
Salvage Plan Guideline\Nand Procedures...
It’s amazing that you could create\Nall this in only one month.
Thanks for giving me credit,\Nbut it wasn’t my idea.
This was already experimental\Nten years ago.
This kind of thing happened\Nduring the development?
It was before I worked here.
My mother was here, though.\NI only know the data.
And how did it come out?
I’ve heard they failed.
Kindness...
Warmth...
Is this the warmth of a human?
I was never aware of it.
What is loneliness?
I was never aware of it,\Nbut now I think I know it.
What is happiness?
I was never aware of it,\Nbut now I think I know it.
Are others kind to you?
Why?
Because I am Eva’s pilot.
Because I pilot Eva,\Nthey treat me well.
That is the reason I can exist.
That is the everything to support\Nmy reason to be.
So, I must pilot Eva.
And then?
Enemy!
Yes, I must fight what they\Nall call the enemy.
And then?
And I must win!
Right, I can’t lose.
As they tell me to, I must pilot Eva.
As they tell me to, I must win!
Otherwise...
Nobody...
Nobody...
Do your best.
Get to work, idiot.
Do your best.
Good work, Shinji.
Misato, Ritsuko, Asuka,\NToji, Kensuke...
...and Father.
They all respect me.
When I pilot Eva, they all respect me.
They respect this worthless being.\NEveryone says to pilot this.
I’ll prove to my dad I’m worthwhile.
Do your best.
Yes, I’m doing my best.
I am doing my best!
Somebody be nice to me.
I fought so hard.  I’m doing my best!
Treat me well!  Be nice to me!!
I’m nice to you.
Tell me, Shinji, do you want\Nto become one with me?
To be of one mind and body?
It could be very, very nice.
Ask me anytime.  I’m ready.
Hey, Shinji-idiot, don’t you want\Nto be one with me?
To be of one mind and body?
It could be very, very nice.
You ought to appreciate your\Ngood fortune.  Come on.
Ikari, do you want to become\None with me?
To be of one mind and body?
It could be very, very nice.
Ikari?
Do you want to become one with me?
To be of one mind and body and soul?
It could be very, very nice.
Relax and release your soul.
All investigative needles fixed.
Fixed at electromagnetic radius\Nof 0 minus 3.
Ego border pulse\Nconnection is complete.
Roger.
Start salvage.
Roger.  Transmitting first signal.
Eva has received the signal.\NNo rejection confirmed.
Proceeding to second and third signals.
Subject cathexis is normal.
Destrudo is not confirmed.
Roger.  Shift the subject to stage two.
Shinji...
Hey, Shinji-idiot!
Shinji!
Hey, Shinji!
Yo, Shinji.
Ikari...
Shinji!
Shinji-idiot!
Shinji!
Hey, Shinji!
Yo, Shinji.
Ikari...
Shinji!
Shinji-idiot!
Shinji!
Hey, Shinji!
Yo, Shinji.
Ikari...
Shinji!
Shinji-idiot!
Shinji!
Hey, Shinji!
Yo, Shinji.
Ikari...
It’s no good.  The Ego borderline\Nis frozen in a loop.
Irradiate the wave patterns in\Nall directions.
It won’t work.  The signals are\Ntrapped in Klein space.
What does that mean?
It means we failed.
Abort intervention!  Reverse tangent\Nplug!  Return additions to zero.
Yes, ma’am.
Destrudo reaction in the old area!\NPattern Sepia!
A change is confirmed on the core\Npulse, too!  Plus 0.3 is confirmed!!
Maintenance of the status quo is top\Npriority!  Prevent backflow!
Yes, ma’am.
Plus 0.5!  0.8!  This is odd!\NI can’t stop it!
What is this?!  Why?  Don’t you want\Nto come back, Shinji?
I don’t understand.
I...  I...
What do you wish?
What do you wish?
Eva has rejected the signal!
LCL self-replenishment is dropping!
Pressure in the plug is increasing!
Abort all operations!  Cut the power!
It doesn’t work!  Plug is being ejected!
Shinji!
Where am I?
Inside of Eva.
Inside of Eva?
Did I pilot Eva again?  Why?
You won’t pilot the Eva anymore?
I decided I will never pilot Eva again.
But you have just piloted\NEvangelion Unit 01.
Shinji, you are here because you\Nhave piloted the Eva.
Piloting the Eva has created\Nyour present.
You can never deny your past, Shinji,\Nnor can you deny the fact that you\Ndid indeed pilot it once more.
That which is, is.  It’s true.
I just wanted to tell you that\Nonly you can decide.
It’s your future.
I....  I...
What good is your damned science?!\NIt can’t even save one small life?!
Give me back my Shinji!\NGive him back!!
That scent?
A human smell?
Misato?
Ayanami?
No, not them.
That’s right...
This is the smell of my mother.
Second Impact has occurred.\NWill he live in this hell?
Anywhere can be heaven\Nif you try to live.
Because he has a life, as long\Nas he lives, he will have the chance\Nto attain happiness.
Yes, you’re right.
Mom...
Have you decided yet?
If it’s a boy, Shinji.\NIf it’s a girl, I’ll name the baby Rei.
Shinji...  Rei...
Mom...
Shinji!
I see.\N\N\N\N\N
See ya!
Seeing her man as soon\Nas Shinji is saved?
Well, I can’t criticize her.
Ritsuko must be thinking\NI’m pretty disgusting.
Appearing to give in to our sexual\Ndesires makes for a more realistic\Nand human appearance.
We might even fool them.
Fool the intelligence department?
Or the Commander and Ritsuko?
Or me?
No, I meant myself.
You want to fool the others?
You never show interest in others,\Nbut you want their attention.
You really are just like my dad.
A cigarette?\NI didn’t know you still smoke.
I only smoke after this sort of thing.
So nobody knows but you.
I see, I’m honored.
And how’s Instrumentality going?
Adam could wipe out mankind.
Why is it being kept there?
Did you come to see me\Njust to learn that?
Well, that’s one of the reasons.
It would be my honor to be used as\Nmy lady’s cat’s-paw, but I can’t\Ntell you right now.
I just want you to know what I want.
What are NERV and Commander Ikari\Nreally planning?
I’d like to know that myself.
Hey, you can’t dodge my\Nquestions by doing that.
Hey, no!
Don’t put strange things in there!
I can’t believe this.  What?
Here’s a present for you,\Nthe first time in eight years.
And maybe the last as well.
Vice-Commander Fuyutsuki is\Nabducted by SEELE!  It’s a mind warp\Nas the memories are pulled from his mind!
Encounters, separation,\Nand lonely deaths...
The beginning of everything,\Nstarting in Kyoto, 1999.
The memories form the present as\Nothers delve into the organization Ikari\Nand Fuyutsuki have created...
...into the history of the secret\Norganization that they have devoted\Neverything to.
Could NERV really be a fortress\Nfor all mankind?
It’s the next episode,\N“The Birth of NERV.”
Like an angel that has no\Nsense of mercy...
Rise, young boy, to the heavens\Nlike a legend.
Cold winds, as blue as the sea,
Tear open the door to\Nyour heart, I see.
But unknowing you seem, just\Nstaring at me...
Standing there smiling serenely.
Desperate, for something to touch...
A moment of kindness like\Nthat in a dream.
Your innocent eyes, have yet no idea...
Of the path your destiny will follow.
But someday you’ll become aware of...
Everything that you’ve got behind you.
Your wings are for seeking out a new...
Future that only you can search for.
The cruel angel’s thesis enters through\Nthe window of your soul.
If you should betray the chapel\Nof your memories.
The cruel angel’s thesis bleeds through\Na portal like your pulsing blood.
So, boy, stand tall and embrace\Nthe fire of the legend,
Embracing the universe like\Na blazing star!
Hi!  I’m not in right now,\Nso leave your message after the beep!
This may be my last assignment.
This looks like blood.
The Vice-Commander was abducted?
Two hours ago.\NHe was last seen in the 8th District.
That’s inside our installation.
What in the hell were you idiots\Nin Intelligence doing?
The whole thing was set up by someone\Ninside our operation.
We were taken by surprise.
Someone who could outwit Section 2?\NIt couldn’t be him?!
Ryoji Kaji is suspected of being the\Nmastermind behind this plot.
Then, that’s why you came for me.
We believe that you can\Nbe of use to us, yes.
As your colleagues,\Nwe regret having to consider\Nthe Director of Operations a suspect...
...but that is the nature of our profession.
Considering our relationship,\Nit’s a natural precaution.
I appreciate your cooperation.
Take her away.
It’s been a while, Chairman Keel.\NThis is a rather rough reception.
I will not apologize\Nfor necessary discourtesies.
This was necessary in order for us\Nto speak with you outside of the\NCommander’s presence.
You haven’t changed.  You still have no\Nconcern for the circumstances of others.
The subject to be addressed\Nhas become an immediate concern.\NThus, these measures were unavoidable.
Please understand our situation.
What a surprise.\NNot the committee, but SEELE itself!
We have no intention of\Ncreating a new god.
We hope that we will have your\Ncooperation, Professor Fuyutsuki.
Professor!  Professor Fuyutsuki!
Hello, boys.
Why don’t you join us for a beer\Nby the Kamo River?
What, again?
Ryoko and the other girls said\Nthey’ll come if you come.
The professor said that you shouldn’t\Nbe so unsociable.
All right, I’ll be there.
It’s nice to have a drink outside\Nfor a change.
Yeah...
You’re very competent,\Nbut you tend to underestimate\Nthe value of relationships with others.
I’m sorry, sir.
Speaking of which, Fuyutsuki...
...there’s a student who wrote\Na very interesting research paper\Nfor the bio-engineering class.
Her name is Ikari.  Do you know her?
Ikari?  No, sir.
I’ve told her about you,\Nand she says she’d like to meet you.
She’ll be calling you soon,\Nand I’d like you to take her on.
And her name is Ikari?  I understand.
I’ve read your paper.
There are a few things I disagree with,\Nbut it’s really very interesting.
Thank you, sir.
Your name is Yui Ikari, right?
Yes.
What are your career plans?\NCorporate research?
Or joining the school research facility?
I haven’t really thought about it.
And there may be a third option.
I’m also thinking about getting married...
...assuming that I meet the right person.
By incorporating the S2 unit into itself,\Nit has achieved its ultimate form.
Evangelion Unit 01!
A supreme being which we created.\NWhat blasphemy!
The creation of a god is unacceptable.
Man must not create gods.  We cannot\Nallow him to possess such power!
Can we trust Gendo Ikari?
Gendo Rokubungi?\NWell, I have heard the name.
No, I’ve never met him.
However, he does seem to be\Nat the center of many rumors.
He wants to be released into my custody?
Yes, I’ll come visit him.\NWhat time should I come?
I’ve been hearing some interesting things\Nabout you.  I’ve been wanting to meet you.
You were drunk and got into a fight.\NHow pathetic.
I didn’t even have a chance to say\Nanything before they jumped me.
I’m not used to being liked.  Being hated,\Non the other hand, is quite familiar.
That’s not my concern.
Professor Fuyutsuki, you are exactly the\Nkind of person I expected you to be.
My first impression of him was that\Nhe was a total son of a bitch.
Back then, there were still seasons\Nin this country.  It was autumn.
Are you serious?
Yes, I’m dating Mr. Rokubungi.
When she told me that,\NI couldn’t hide my shock.
It’s hard to imagine you walking with him.
Now, Professor Fuyutsuki...
...he’s actually a very sweet person.
It’s just that nobody really knows him.
Sometimes ignorance can be bliss.
I’m the one who first mentioned you\Nto him.  Does that bother you?
Well, I’ll admit that he’s an interesting\Nfellow, but I just don’t like him.
Actually, it was generally believed that the\Nreal object of his overtures to Yui...
...was her talent and the support of the\Norganization that was backing her.
According to the rumors,\Nthat organization was called SEELE.
Second Impact...
...it was in the last year of the 20th century\Nthat this tragedy occurred.
Then, in the first year of the 21st century\Nthere was nothing but hell.
I can’t find any other words\Nto describe that year.
This used to be a continent of ice?
There’s no sign left of it!
Professor Fuyutsuki...
Is that you?  You survived?
I’d heard that you were with the\NKatsuragi research team.
Fortunately, I returned to Japan\Nthe day before the incident.
You don’t say.
Mr. Rokubungi, you...
Excuse me, but I’ve changed my surname.
A postcard?  Not a business card?
Ikari!  Gendo Ikari!
My wife’s been asking me to send this to\Nyou.  She says she’s a fan of yours.
What an honor.
How is Yui doing?\NShe’s not participating in this expedition?
Yui wanted to come too,\Nbut we have a child now.
Your organization, SEELE or whatever it’s\Ncalled, is at the root of many ugly rumors.
I don’t like the way that it manipulates\Nthe committee by force.
You’re still too scrupulous.
No completely chaste organization\Ncan survive in this day and age.
If this official investigation of the Second\NImpact was composed solely of SEELE\Npersonnel, there would have been trouble.
So, are we just here for\Npolitical convenience?
Who is she?
The only survivor of the research team.
Her name is Misato Katsuragi.
Katsuragi?\NIs she Doctor Katsuragi’s daughter?
Yes, she hasn’t said a word in two years.
How terrible...
She saw hell firsthand.
Her physical wounds are healed,\Nbut repairing the damage to\Nher mind will take time.
That’s true.
The results of our investigation\Naren’t easy to analyze.
The origin of this Giant of Light is but one\Nof many mysteries we have yet to solve.
The Second Impact was caused\Nby a massive meteorite strike, or so\Nthe United Nations officially declared later.
However, from my point of view...
...the announcement was obviously\Na fabrication.
The organization known as SEELE and a\Nman named Keel were behind this artifice.
It became my goal to find\Nout the truth about the incident...
...even though I discovered that\NYui Ikari was involved.
Why did you conceal the\Nexistence of the Giant?
You knew that the Second Impact was\Ngoing to happen, didn’t you?
You may have said that it was just\Nluck that you returned the day\Nbefore it happened...
...but how do you explain the fact that you\Nbrought back copies of all\Nthe documentation?!
I’m surprised that those weren’t destroyed.
I’ve checked into your finances as well.
Bringing up a child and educating him is\Nexpensive, but isn’t this a bit much?
Very impressive, Professor Fuyutsuki.\NPerhaps you should be teaching\Neconomics.
I’m going to go public with the real\Ntruth about the Second Impact, about you,\NSEELE and the Dead Sea Scrolls.
I can’t forgive anyone who would have\Ncaused something like that.
As you wish.
However, before you do that,\Nthere’s something I’d like to show you.
We’re getting rather far down, aren’t we?
Are you worried?
A little.
What is this?
We didn’t create it,\Nsomeone else excavated this cavity.
89% of its total volume is buried.
Was this originally a giant sphere?
This facility is what has been consuming\Nthe total resources of mankind.
Hi, Professor Fuyutsuki!
Doctor Akagi, you’re here, too?
Yes, this is the ideal place for\Nour research into creating a functioning\Nbio-computer system.
I’m going to name them the “MAGI.”
“MAGI”?  The three wise men of the east.
Is this what you wanted to show me?
No, it’s over this way.
Ritsuko, I’ll be back soon.
Is this...
This can’t be THE Giant?
No, here at Gehirn,\Nwe refer to that giant as “Adam”...
...but this isn’t the original one.
Then, this...?
...was created from Adam by man, Eva.
Eva?
Our operation to revive Adam is referred\Nto as Project E.  This is Eva Unit 00,\Nour system prototype.
This is a prototype of a god!
Fuyutsuki, let us create a new genesis\Nfor mankind, together.
Hey, boss...
I’m sorry.  Let’s proceed with Rei’s re-test.
Where is Major Katsuragi today?
I don’t know.
Miss Katsuragi?
Yeah, Misato Katsuragi,\Npleased to meet you.
Mother, I have just become acquainted\Nwith a girl named Katsuragi.
Most people tend to keep their distance\Nfrom me once they find out who I am...
...which forces me to remember how\Nimportant your name is around here.
However, Misato is different.\NShe’s very open and honest, even with me.
I’ve heard that she is the only survivor of\Nthe original research team...
...and that she was once mute.
She talks quite a lot now, almost as if\Nshe’s trying to make up for lost time.
Dear Ritsuko,\NI’m always underground these days...
...and I’m getting sick of living on the\Nbox lunches they provide here.
On the surface, they’ve started\Nconstruction of Tokyo-3, as directed\Nby the Second Capitol Transfer Directive.
Misato didn’t show up for classes the last\Nfew days, and I finally forced her to tell\Nme why.  Talk about stupid!
She’d spent the whole week having\Nnon-stop sex with her new boyfriend!
I think there’s another side to her\NI haven’t seen before.
She introduced me to him today.
He’s handsome,\Nbut his unkempt manner bothers me.
You’ve always been a little\Nboy-shy, Ritsuko dear.
I think it’s because you only had a mother.
And I’m afraid I didn’t take\Ncare of you properly.
I’m ashamed to admit that I only acted like\Na mother when it suited my whims.
Like a mother...
Why is there a child in here?!
That’s Director Ikari’s son.
Ikari, this is not a day-care center.\NThis is a very important day!
I’m sorry, Professor.  I brought him here.
Yui, this is your experiment today.
That’s why I brought him.  I want to show\Nhim how bright the future will be.
Those words would be Yui’s last.
A freak accident wiped her\Nfrom this existence.
Just as I had hoped it would.
What a disgusting woman I am.
Ritsuko, after that day, Director Ikari\Ncompletely changed.
Where have you been all week?
I understand your grief...
...but you must be aware of your\Nown importance!
I know.  Fuyutsuki, as of today we\Nwill begin the new project.
I have already made the proposal\Nto Chairman Keel.
You’re really going to do it?!
Yes, that which has never been achieved\Nbefore, the path to becoming a god!
The Human Instrumentality Project.
Mother, congratulations on completing\Nyour “MAGI” theorems.
I have good news which I think\Nwill please you, too.
I have been officially accepted by Gehirn!
I’ll start working on Project E next month.
Who are you?
Technology Development Section,\NRitsuko Akagi.  Here’s my ID.
I heard that the basic installation of\Nthe Command Center had been completed,\Nso I came to see it.
But it’s a real maze down here, isn’t it?
The Director and Doctor Akagi will\Nsee you in the Command Center.
Are you really all right?
Yes, I have no regrets about my work.
You’re lying!  You still can’t forget\Nabout Yui, can you?!
But that’s acceptable to me.
That’s Gehirn Headquarters.
Good morning, Director.
Did you bring your child?
Oh, I thought you had a son.
This isn’t Shinji.  I’ve decided to take\Ncare of an acquaintance’s child.
Her name is Rei Ayanami.
How are you, Rei?
All of the records concerning Rei Ayanami\Nhave been deleted?
They’re all blank!
What’s going on here?
MAGI Casper...
MAGI Balthasar...
MAGI Melchior...
The MAGI are the three aspects of me.
Myself as a scientist, myself as a mother\Nand myself as a woman.
Those three aspects are in constant\Nconflict with one another.
Three mothers...
The only thing left to do\Nis to switch the power on.
I’ll be taking off early today.\NMisato just got back.
Yeah, I heard that she joined Gehirn.
In Germany, if I remember correctly?
Yeah, she’s stationed with the 3rd Branch.
So, she’s having a\Nlong-distance relationship.
They broke up.
Oh, but they seemed like\Nsuch a perfect couple.
The things that happen between men and\Nwomen are hard to comprehend.
They’re not logical.
You’re always so cold about these things.
You may lose your chance at happiness.
The definition of happiness is\Neven harder to fathom.
Well, I can’t wait to see her.
Have a good time.
A good time it is.
What’s the matter, Rei?
I’m lost.
Is that so?\NDo you want to come with me then?
No.
But how will you get home by yourself?
That’s none of your business, old hag.
What?
I can get home by myself.\NLeave me alone, old hag.
You shouldn’t call someone a hag.
But you are an old hag, aren’t you?
I’m getting angry.\NDirector Ikari will spank you.
The Director is the one\Nwho calls you that.
That’s...
“That old hag is annoying.\NThat old hag is no use anymore.”
“That old hag is annoying.\NThat old hag is no use anymore.”
...old hag...  old hag...
“That old hag is annoying.\NThat old hag is no use anymore.”
The Director said...
...that old hag is annoying.
...no use...  no use...
Keel Lorenz, chairman of the\NInstrumentality Committee...
...dissolved the Gehirn Research\NOrganization immediately.
In order to complete the project, the\Nspecial organization “NERV” was formed.
We all transferred to NERV,\Nexcept for one person...
...the one who had rendered\Nsuch remarkable service to the\NMAGI System, Dr. Akagi.
Oh, it’s you.
Yes, it is.
It’s been a while.  The guards are sleeping.
This action could result in your death.
All I want is to get closer to the truth...
...to have it in my grasp.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Is it over?
Yes, the problem has been solved.
I see.
Where is he?
I have no idea.
Oh, hi!  You’re a little late.
I’m back.
Katsuragi, it’s me.
I’m sure you’re listening to this message,\Nespecially after I caused you\Nso much trouble.
Sorry.
Please tell Ritsuko “I’m sorry,” too.
And there’s one more thing to trouble you\Nwith.  I’ve been growing melons.
I’d appreciate it if you could\Nwater them for me.
Shinji knows where they are.
Katsuragi, the truth is with you.\NDon’t hesitate, move ahead!
If I ever see you again...
...I’ll say the words that I couldn’t\Nsay eight years ago.
Bye.
This message was recorded at 12:02 PM.
You fool...
You were always such a fool...
All I could do was run away from the\Ntragedy Misato was facing.
There was nothing I could say.
I was just a child...
...but I understood.
Having been surpassed by Shinji yet again,\NAsuka falls into a dark pit of despair...
...and the damage inflicted in the next\NAngel’s attack is even more horrifying.
Shinji can find no words to soothe\Nher shattered soul.
It’s the next episode,\N“At Least, Be Humane.”

The fiction has become the reality.\NHow ironic, that the experiment’s\Nadvocate became its victim.
So, you believe that the contact\Nexperiment was the direct cause?
Her mental breakdown was\Na result of the contact.
Even so, this is too cruel,\Ncommitting suicide and leaving such\Na young girl behind.
Perhaps, but I believe that there may have\Nbeen some additional causes.
Asuka darling, Mama cooked your\Nfavorite for you.
Oh, no, you have to eat this or\Nthat girl will laugh at you.
She’s like that every day.\NShe just sits there, talking to that doll\Nas if it were her real daughter.
I think it’s because of the guilt\Nshe must feel.
She devoted her entire life to her research,\Nnot to taking care of her own daughter.
I sympathize with your grief.
But, it’s like looking at porcelain figures\Nof a mother and her child.
Perhaps there really isn’t much difference\Nbetween humans and dolls.
Man creates dolls in his own image.
If God exists, it’s possible that we’re\Nall just dolls to him.
Saying things like that doesn’t make you\Nsound like much of a modern physician.
I may be a doctor, but I’m a human\Nbeing and a woman, first.
The Medical Staff conference on the\NE Incident will be held as planned.
All senior staff should report to\NConference Room 2.
You’re a strong girl, Asuka,\Nbut it’s all right if you want to cry.
I’m okay.  I won’t cry.
I can think for myself.
Can you hear me, Asuka?  Your synch\Nratio has dropped an entire eight points.
Don’t think about anything else,\Njust concentrate the way you used to.
I’m trying!
Asuka’s synch ratio is getting\Nlower and lower.
This is extremely troublesome.\NWe don’t have a spare now.
Maybe we’d better make repairing\NRei’s Unit 00 top priority.
We can’t afford to repair them\Nboth at the same time.
Mitosis process in the left arm of Unit 02\Nhas cleared the numerical requirement.
Necrosis development is\Ncurrently under 0.05%.
Apotheosis process is in nominal status.
Unit 00’s regeneration process\Ncurrently stable.
Connecting receptors to the\Nsecondary terminals.
Now we’re using the force which caused\Nthe Second Impact to defeat the Angels.
Attempting to harness the engine\Nof our own destruction...
After all, I myself hate the Evas.
Revenge for my father?!
Major Katsuragi!
They’ve started construction on\NEvas up through Unit 13?
At seven different locations\Naround the world?
This information came via Shanghai.\NThe source is reliable.
Why are they speeding up the\Nconstruction process now?
Well, we’ve lost two Evas recently,\Nand two more Evas are currently\Nseverely damaged.
So I’d assume that they’re accelerating\Nto create a reserve force for their\Ncontingency plans.
Perhaps...
...but we’ve been receiving spare parts\Nfrom Germany that were originally\Nintended for Evas Units 05 and 06.
They’ve been spending a lot of cash lately.
They just doubled the budget.  I think the\Nbrass are being driven by something.
Yeah, I can feel\Nthe committee’s impatience.
Well, could they be doing this\Nin anticipation of intercepting multiple\NAngels at once?
Could be...
...except that there’s no reason for them to\Ndo it outside of official channels.
There must be some other reason.
This is the first time all three of us have\Ngotten together in a while, so what’s with\Nthe gloomy atmosphere?
I’m finished.
Asuka!
I’m not getting it.  After all, it’s probably\NKaji calling for Misato.  You should get it.
Never again...
Oh no, I’m sorry that our mighty invincible\NShinji should have to be bothered\Nwith such a thing.
Yes, hello?
I can’t stand the way he’s so aloof!
It’s a call from Germany for Asuka.
It’s your mother.
For me?  My mama?
Give me that!
Hello, Mother?
Her mother...
You were on the phone quite a while.
Well, it was just a\Nroutine periodic communication.
I wish I could talk with my family.
Well, it’s just for show.\NShe’s not my real mother.
But, it’s not like I hate her or anything\Nlike that.  I just feel uncomfortable\Ntalking with her.
Why am I telling you this?!
Sorry.
I know I’ve hit rock bottom when I\Nget sympathy from you!
Synchrograph, minus 12.8.\NIt’s barely over the starting indicator.
That’s pathetic.\NIt’s a worse score than yesterday.
Asuka’s not feeling well,\Nit’s the second day of her period.
Synch ratio scores aren’t influenced\Nby physical disorders.
The problem’s in her subconscious.
Asuka, you’re finished now.
Maybe the time has come for the three\Nof us to stop living together.
So you’ve hit your breaking point?
Are you fed up with your nice\Nimitation family?
I don’t have to take that from someone\Nwho tries to fill the holes in her\Nown empty life with cats.
I’m sorry.  I’m just a little upset.
Why do I suffer through this\Njust because I’m a girl?
I don’t want to have children anyway.
Route 7 Loop is currently closed\Ndue to an accident.
Please use Route 12 as a detour...
If you don’t open your mind to her,\Nyour Eva will not move.
Are you saying that I’m\Nshutting myself out?!
Yes, because your Eva has her own mind.
The robot does?
You’re aware of it, aren’t you?
I don’t know what happened to make you\Nstart talking to me.  It must be an omen\Nof a disaster or something!
What?!  Are you happy that\NI can’t pilot my Eva?!
Don’t worry!  When an Angel comes,\Nour invincible Shinji will destroy it anyway!
We don’t have to fight!\NThey only need Shinji!
When a wind-up doll like you starts\Nbeing sympathetic to me...
...I’ve really hit rock bottom.
I am not a doll.
Shut up!  You do anything you’re\Nordered to, don’t you?!
You’d kill yourself if Commander Ikari\Ntold you to, wouldn’t you?!
Yes, I would.
Then you’re a toy, just like I thought!
You’re an unthinking, emotionless\Ndoll and I hate you!
Everyone!  I hate everyone!
Shinji’s absent again today.
It’s nothing unusual for Ayanami\Nnot to show up, but...
Asuka’s missing, too.
And Suzuhara can’t leave the hospital yet.
I guess the situation’s gotten so serious\Nthey can’t come to school anymore.
Eva Unit 02’s signals all read nominal.
Connection and fusion of VA’s\Nare within normal limits.
The field of proliferation is within\Nthe expected range.
You’re my doll, so move like I tell\Nyou to and don’t argue!
Why does a weapon need a mind?\NIt just gives you trouble.
Anyway, you must obey my orders!
This is stupid.
All personnel, go to first stage alert!\NPrepare for aerial assault!
An Angel?  They’re still coming?
Visual confirmation of Angel.\NThis is maximum magnification.
It’s not moving from its orbit.
It’s maintaining a constant distance\Nfrom our position.
So, does that mean that it’s looking\Nfor a place to land?
Or that it’s going to destroy us\Nfrom up there?
We can’t attack it easily from this position.
Unless it comes into our range,\Nthere’s nothing we can do.
The Evas can’t destroy an enemy\Nthat’s in orbit.
What’s Rei’s status?
She and Unit 00 are both\Nin good condition.
Understood.
Sortie Unit 00.\NPrepare for extreme long range firing.
Unit 02, Asuka, be ready to\Nsortie as her backup.
Backup?  Me?  For Unit 00?!
That’s right, take the rear guard position.
You can’t be serious...
Eva Unit 02 launch!
Asuka!
It’s okay.  Let her take point\Nif that’s what she wants.
Major Katsuragi?!
If she fails this time,\NAsuka won’t be allowed to pilot anymore.
You mean this is her last chance?
We’d better start making preparations to\Nreplace Unit 02’s pilot, just in case.
Yes, ma’am.
Excuse me, but aren’t you\Ngoing to sortie Unit 01?
It’s to remain frozen.\NThose are Commander Ikari’s orders.
If I fail this time, they’re not going\Nto let me pilot anymore.
You can’t make any mistakes\Nthis time, Asuka.
The target is still out of the range.
Why in the hell are you so slow?!\NCome on down, you lazy Angel!
The Angel has a particle beam weapon?!
No, there are no thermal emissions\Nbeing detected.
We’ve got abnormal readings in her\Npsychograph!  Mental contamination\Nis about to begin!
The Angel’s making a psychic attack?
The Angels don’t understand\Nour minds that well!
Goddamn it!!
Positrons dissipated!
It’s not working!  It’s too far out of range!
Unit 02’s rifle is out of ammunition.
What’s the result of the beam analysis?
It’s an energy oscillation pattern\Non a visible wavelength.
It’s similar to an AT Field,\Nbut we don’t know much more.
How’s Asuka?
Her situation is critical.\NThe mental contamination is crossing\Nher Ego borderline!
Noooo!
Don’t!  Don’t come into me!
Pain!
No!
No!
No!
Get out of my mind!
Please!  Don’t rape my mind!
Asuka!
Psychograph shows she\Ncan’t take anymore!
Yes, her mental circuits are being\Ndestroyed.  This is too dangerous for her.
Asuka!  Retreat!
No!
That was an order!\NAsuka, I’m ordering you to retreat!
No!  Never!\NI’d rather die than retreat now!!
Asuka!
Accelerator synchronization initiated.
Voltage is increasing.\NApproaching pressure zone.
Compulsory focus convergence, activated.
Correction for the Earth’s rotation\Nand gravity, 0.03.
Pressure in the chamber is at maximum.
Release the final safety lock.\NAll personnel, prepare for firing.
Negative effect!  There wasn’t\Nenough energy to penetrate its AT Field\Nfrom this distance.
But we’re at maximum power output!\NWe can’t get any more power!
Unit 02’s psychograph is getting weak!
What about the LCL mind barrier?
Negative!  We can’t even hope\Nfor a buffering effect.
Switch top priority to life support.\NDon’t let the Eva feed back.
Yes, ma’am!
Why am I crying?\NI swore that I wouldn’t cry anymore.
What’s wrong, Asuka?
This is a present from your new mother.\NDon’t you like it?
No!
But why not?
Because I’m not a child!
I’ll grow up faster than other people.\NI don’t need a stuffed toy.
Please, look at me!  Mama!\NI beg you, don’t stop being my mama.
Come to heaven with me.
Mama!  Mama!  Please, don’t kill me!
No!  I’m not Mama’s doll!\NI’ll think for myself, and I’ll live for myself!
I don’t need a papa or mama,\NI’ll live on my own.
No!  Don’t make me remember that!
I want to forget those things!\NDon’t dig them up from my mind!
I don’t want those terrible\Nmemories anymore.
Please, stop this!  Stop this!
My mind’s being contaminated.
Kaji!  My mind’s being raped!
What will I do?  It’s defiling my mind!
Unit 02 has ceased activation!
The life support system has crashed!
Pilot’s mind is entering danger zone.
Target position is constant.\NRelative distance has not changed.
Possibility of the target coming into\NUnit 00’s range is 0.02%.
Could we airlift Unit 00 and\Ntry shooting from the sky?
No, we can’t do that.\NIf the Angel attacked during the approach,\Nwe couldn’t protect it.
I’ll go out in Unit 01!
No!  This target has the ability to\Nattack the pilot’s mind.
We cannot allow an invasion of Unit 01.
But that can’t happen as long as\NI’m not defeated, right?
There is no guarantee that\Nyou will succeed.
But if we don’t, Asuka will...
I don’t care.  Rei, go to Dogma\Nand get the Lance.
The Lance of Longinus?!\NYou can’t do that, Ikari!
There’s no other way to destroy a\Ntarget that remains beyond the reach of\Nour AT Fields.
Hurry!
But if Adam and the Eva come into\Ncontact, it might cause the Third Impact!
It’s too dangerous!\NCommander Ikari, please don’t do this!
Opening Central Dogma barriers\N10 through 15.
Unit 00 has passed the 6th Malvoisie.
Now opening barriers 16 through 20.
Ikari, I still think it’s too early to use this.
The committee has\Nalready started to mass produce Evas.\NThis is our chance, Fuyutsuki.
But...
We cannot make time run backwards...
...but we can spur its course forward\Nwith our own hands.
The old men won’t allow this.
Therefore, we must finish this before\NSEELE has time to act.
It is not acceptable to lose\NUnit 02 at this time.
But you can’t use the Lance of Longinus\Nwithout SEELE’s approval.
The need is the justification.\NThere are no other factors to consider.
Justification?  No, what you’re\Nlooking for is an excuse.
Unit 02’s pilot’s EKG has\Ndropped to 0.06.
We’re past the limits of the\Nlife support system.
Unit 00 is passing through Vent 2.\NShe’s approaching the surface!
That’s the Lance of Longinus?
Unit 00 is in position to throw.
Target sighted.\NError corrections have been made.
Starting countdown.  Going from 10.
8...
7...
6...
5...
4...
3...
2...
1...
Zero!
Target annihilated.
Eva Unit 02 is free.
What about the Lance of Longinus?
It passed escape velocity.\NIt’s moving into a lunar orbit.
It’s impossible to recover it now.
Yes, sir.  We have no method to recover\Nan object of that much mass.
Unit 02’s psychograph is\Nreturning to normal.
Return the Evangelion to the second cage.
Please use Route 67.
How’s Asuka?
We’ve confirmed that the pilot is alive,\Nand we’ve established quarantine\Nfor the contamination.
I see.
I’m glad you’re okay, Asuka.
Shut up!  Who the hell is “okay”?!\NHow could it get any worse?
That little bitch rescued me.\NThat little bitch rescued ME.
I’d rather have died!
I hate you!  I hate you!  I hate everyone!\NI hate you!
Unit 00 is possessed and\Ncorroded by an Angel.
In order to protect Shinji from the Angel...
...Rei wishes herself dead.
She becomes light and heat to\Ndisappear with Tokyo-3.
It’s the next episode, “Tear.”
Like an angel that has no\Nsense of mercy...
Rise, young boy, to the heavens\Nlike a legend.
Cold winds, as blue as the sea,
Tear open the door to\Nyour heart, I see.
But unknowing you seem, just\Nstaring at me...
Standing there smiling serenely.
Desperate, for something to touch...
A moment of kindness like\Nthat in a dream.
Your innocent eyes, have yet no idea...
Of the path your destiny will follow.
But someday you’ll become aware of...
Everything that you’ve got behind you.
Your wings are for seeking out a new...
Future that only you can search for.
The cruel angel’s thesis enters through\Nthe window of your soul.
If you should betray the chapel\Nof your memories.
The cruel angel’s thesis bleeds through\Na portal like your pulsing blood.
So, boy, stand tall and embrace\Nthe fire of the legend,
Embracing the universe like\Na blazing star!
Katsuragi, it’s me.  You’re probably\Nlistening to this after I caused\Nyou a lot of trouble.
I’m sorry.
Please tell Ritsuko I’m sorry, too.
There’s one more thing I’d like\Nto trouble you with.  There are\Nsome melons I was raising.
I’d be happy if you’d take care of\Nthem.  Shinji knows where they are.
Katsuragi, the truth is with you.\NGo for it.
If I ever see you again, I’ll say the\Nwords I didn’t eight years ago.
Bye.
Another phone that will never ring...
Misato is shutting herself up...
Asuka’s not coming back, is she?
Hikari?
Wh...what is it?
I want to go to bed.
I’m sorry.  I’m causing\Nyou a lot of trouble.
No, not at all.
I lost.  Now, it’s not worth living.
I hate this.  I hate everything.\NMost of all, I hate myself.
I don’t find value in\Nmy life anymore.
I think, you can choose to do\Nanything you want, and I\Nwouldn’t say anything.
You did your best, Asuka.
So, you haven’t seen her?\NYeah, I think so, too.
The cat has come to the end of her life.\NDon’t cry, Grandma.
Yes, I’ll come home as soon as I can.\NIt’s been three years since I visited\Nmy mom’s grave.
I’ll call you.
Well, I’ll talk to you later.
So, the cat died.
Now it’s impossible to recover the\NLance of Longinus.
Why did you use it?
Are you aware that we do not have\Nenough of the Eva series yet?
Destroying Angels is our top\Npriority.  This is the fact\Nwe have to face.
Is that it?  You should come up\Nwith a better excuse.
You’re disrespectful to the\Ncommittee these days.
Fuyutsuki, we’re in the middle\Nof deliberations.
I understand.
There is an Angel approaching.\NLet us adjourn for now.
Your seat will be waiting for you.
Will Ikari betray SEELE?
I’ll be there in 15 minutes.
Sortie Unit 00 through the 32nd.\NDeploy Unit 02 as backup.
Yes, the Commander will direct\NUnit 01.  I don’t have the\Nauthority to release it.  Later.
The Angel is sighted...
Unit 00 launched.  Deploying\Nto interception point.
Hold Unit 02 at its current position.
No, launch it.
Commander?!
Go ahead.  It can be used as a decoy.
Yes, sir.
Eva Unit 02, preparing for launch.
I’m in this thing again.\NHow irresolute I am.
Send Unit 02 to Gate Eight.  As soon\Nas a location is designated,\Nwe’ll launch.
I’m just a deadweight for you, right?
Target is approaching and has passed\Nthe Gora Final Interception Line.
Whatever, doesn’t matter.
Target is rotating in the\Nair over Owakudani.
Target’s AT Field is active.
What were you doing?
I’m sorry.
Status report!
We’re at a stalemate.
The pattern is periodically changing\Nfrom blue to orange.
What does that mean?
The MAGI are still working\Non the answer.
There is insufficient information for\Nthem to derive an answer.
The only thing we’re sure of is that\Nthis shape is not its only form.
We’ll have to wait and see.
Rei, you have to stay ready.
No, it’s coming.
Rei, fight back!
No, it’s too late!
Target has made physical\Ncontact with Unit 00!
What about Unit 00’s AT Field?
It’s active, but it’s being eroded!
Is the Angel trying to make\Nfirst contact with Unit 00?
This is deadly!  Unit 00’s biological\Nparts are corroding.
Eva Unit 02 launch!\NBack Rei up and save her!
Target is eroding Unit 00.
This could be fatal.  The biological\Ncomponents are already more\Nthan 5% fused.
Asuka, advance 300 meters, spread\Nyour AT Field to maximum, and fire\Nthe Palette Gun into the target’s rear.
You got it?  Eva Unit 02, lift off!
Go ahead!  Asuka, what\Nare you doing?
Status?!
It’s no good.  Synch ratio is under 10.
Asuka!
It won’t go.  It just won’t go.
She’ll just be destroyed.\NRetrieve!  Hurry!
Who is this?
This is you.
Myself in Eva?
No, I sense someone\Nother than myself.
Who are you?
Angel?  A man who we\Ncall an Angel?
Why don’t we become one?
No, I am me.  Not you.
Okay, but it’s too late.
Let me share my heart with you.\NLet me share this feeling with you.
Doesn’t this hurt?\NDoesn’t your heart hurt?
Pain?  No, not pain.
Loneliness?
Yes, I’m lonely.
Loneliness?  I don’t understand it.
You don’t want to be by\Nyourself, correct?
We are many, but you are alone.\NYou hate it, don’t you?
That is loneliness.
That is your soul.
That is your soul filled with sorrow.
Is this a tear?
Am I the one who is crying?
Rei!
Remove the restraints from Unit 01\Nand sortie it immediately.
Sortie it.
Yes, sir!
Am I so worthless to you?\NYou didn’t do this for me.
Spread your AT Field.\NRescue Rei immediately.
Yes!
Ikari?!
Does my soul want to\Nbecome one with Ikari?
No!
AT Field has been reversed!\NIt will be corroded immediately.
Is she going to hold the Angel?
Rei, abandon Unit 00!  Evacuate!
No, I can’t do it.  I must stay to keep\Nthe AT Field in effect.
Therefore, I won’t retreat.
Rei, are you going to kill yourself?
The core will be destroyed!\NCritical pressure exceeded!
The target is destroyed.
This operation is officially over.\NGo to first stage alert.
Roger!  Changing to status\NYellow immediately.
What is Unit 00’s status?
The entry plug was not ejected.
Rescue the pilot as soon as possible.
If she’s still alive.
Doctor Akagi...
Keep this top secret.  Retrieve the\Nplug and destroy all the parts.
Roger.
Let’s go!  Hurry up!
We have destroyed the Sixteenth Angel.
Now there is only one left according\Nto SEELE’s Dead Sea Scrolls.
The promised day is near.
The way has been long and\Nour losses are significant.
Right, we lost the Lance of\NLonginus and now we’ve\Nlost Unit 00.
This is sufficient to remove Ikari.
I thought he’d be smart enough to\Nunderstand our intentions in\Nreleasing Fuyutsuki.
We have to find another pawn\Nto use against Ikari.
One who knows the facts.
Shinji, can I come in?
Misato, I don’t have any tears.
I feel sadness,\Nbut the tears won’t come.
Shinji...
...this is all I can do\Nfor you right now.
No, don’t!
Cut it out, Misato!
I’m sorry.
Pen Pen, come on.
Yes, hello.
What did you say?!  Shinji!
Ayanami!
I’m glad you’re alive, Ayanami.
My dad isn’t here?
Thank you for saving my life.
What?
Well, you sacrificed Unit 00\Nto save me.
I see, so did I save you?
Don’t you remember?
No, I don’t know the facts.\NProbably because I’m the third one.
Is this a tear?  I’m seeing this for the\Nfirst time, but it feels familiar.
Am I crying?
Why am I crying?
That’s right.  Status quo for the First\NChild.  No restrictions are necessary.
This applies to the Second and Third\Nas well.  Just watch them.
But the fact that Rei is alive could\Ncause trouble with Chairman Keel.
I have given an alternative to\NSEELE’s old men.  Don’t\Nworry about it.
We’d like to carry this out calmly.\NWe do not want to disgrace you.
I feel no disgrace.
What a strong woman.  I can\Nsee why Ikari wants to keep\Nher next to him.
However, the one who sent you here\Nis none other than Ikari himself.
He refused to let us question the\Npilot of Unit 00 and sent you as\Na substitute, Doctor Akagi.
This is a part of the truth\Nyou wanted to know.
I sent you the same thing thirty-six\Ndifferent ways, but most of those\Nprobably won’t reach you.
I suspect only this capsule\Nwill reach you.
This is my everything.\NDo with it as you will.
The pass code is our first memory.
Bye, take care.
...because I have accepted\Nyour heart.
Are you sure about releasing\NDoctor Akagi?
She isn’t like Fuyutsuki.  It will\Nbe beneficial to release her.
A woman of importance to the Eva project,\Nlet her be of use to us for a while.
Correct, for the future of mankind.
There were to be eight\NEvangelions constructed.
So, there are four more to go.
The disappearance of Tokyo-3 is a\Ngood reason to proceed quickly\Nwith the project.
The promised day shall arrive on the\Nday the Eva series is complete.
Yes, hello.
Listen.  I’ve released your restraint.\NYou can come out now.
Ritsuko?
It’s no use without my password.
I see.  Did Kaji do this?
I will see the secret with\Nmy own eyes.
Okay, but with him, too.
I agree.
This is just like Ayanami’s room.
This IS Rei Ayanami’s room.\NIt’s where she grew up.
This is?
Yes, she was born here.
The light and water that define the\Ndepths of her mind come from\Nimpressions of this place.
Doctor Akagi, I didn’t come\Njust to see this.
I know, Misato.
An Eva?
The very first one.
But it was a failure.  It was\Ndiscarded ten years ago.
An Eva graveyard...
It’s just a trash can.
This is also where your\Nmother disappeared.
You may not remember it...
...but you were watching when your\Nmother disappeared.
Ritsuko!
Is this the source of\Nthe dummy plug?
Let me show you the truth.
Rei Ayanami?
Impossible!  Eva’s dummy plug is...
Right, this is the production factory\Nfor the core of the dummy plug.
This is?
These are all dummies.\NThey are also replacement parts for Rei.
Man found God, and they\Ntried to pick him up.
For that, man was punished!
That happened fifteen years ago,\Nand the God they found disappeared.
Then man tried to resurrect God\Nwith his own hands and that’s\Nhow Adam was created.
From Adam, man created what\Nresembles God Himself.
That is Eva!
So...  are they human?
Yes, they are human.
We put supposedly mindless souls in Eva.
All the souls were salvaged souls.
Rei is the only container that\Ncan hold the souls.
The souls are born only in Rei.\NThe Chamber of Guf is empty.
These are merely empty containers.\NThey have no souls.
So, I want to destroy them\Nbecause I hate them.
Do you know what the\Nhell you’re doing?!
Yes, I do.  I’m destroying them.
They’re not men.  They are\Nthings with human form.
But I lost to these dolls!\NI couldn’t win him!
I could stand any\Nhumiliation for him.
I don’t care how wretched I become!
But...  but he had chosen...  he chose.
I knew this, but...
I’m an idiot!
Both the mother and the\Ndaughter are idiots!
Kill me if you want to.  I’d rather die.
That will not release\Nyou from agony.
The city is gone, his friends have left\Nand a boy smiles at the\Nheartbroken Shinji.
The boy’s casual, embracing\Nsmile enchants Shinji.
However, their cruel destiny\Nhas been preordained.

Momma!  Momma!  They chose me!\NI’m an elite pilot!  I’ll defend\Nmankind!  I’m the best in the world!
I have to keep it a secret, so I’ll\Ntell only you, Momma!
Everybody is being so nice to me\Nnow, I won’t feel so lonely anymore!
I’m okay now, even without Papa.
So, look!  Look at me!!
Momma!
Synch ratio zero.  I can’t be the\NSecond Child anymore.  I have\Nno reason left to live.
Nobody cares about me anymore.
My papa, my momma, nobody cares.
I have no reason left to live.
Are you Asuka Langley Soryu?
The Second Intelligence Division\Nreports that they have taken the\NSecond Child into custody.
Really?  It isn’t like them to lose her\Nin the first place and then to take\Nseven days to find her.
They must have done so intentionally.\NThey’re trying to make trouble\Nfor us, aren’t they?
They could be.
Rei Ayanami...
There’s a feeling about her.
Almost like...  my mother...
Rei Ayanami...  and my mother...
What are you doing with\Nthem, Father?
Commander Ikari...
Did you know my cat died?  The cat\Nmy grandmother was taking care of?
I hadn’t taken care of it for a long\Ntime, but now I know that I’ll\Nnever see it again.
Why did you destroy\Nthe dummy system?
It wasn’t the dummy system that I\Ndestroyed.  It was Rei.
I’ll ask you once more.\NWhy did you do it?
I’m not happy anymore, not even\Nwhen you make love to me.
Go ahead and do whatever you want\Nwith my body, it’s never\Nstopped you before!
You disappoint me.
Disappoint?!
You had no hopes or expectations\Nof me to start with!
I was nothing!  I am nothing!!\NNothing!
What can I do now, Mother?
Asuka, where have you\Ndisappeared to?
Friends...  I don’t have anybody left\Nwhom I could call my friend.
Nobody!
I can’t go see Ayanami again.  I don’t\Nhave the courage to face her.
I don’t even know how to talk or\Nact around her now.
What can I do?
Singing is good.
Singing brings joy and revitalizes the\Nsoul.  I think that song is the greatest\Nachievement of Lilim culture.
Don’t you agree...
...Shinji Ikari?
How do you know my name?
Everyone knows your name.
I don’t mean to sound rude,\Nbut you’re rather ignorant\Nof your own position.
Really?  And you are?
I am Kaoru, Kaoru Nagisa.  I’m like\Nyou, one of the selected children...
...the Fifth Child.
You’re the Fifth Child?!  You...
Mister Nagisa...
Call me Kaoru, Mister Ikari.
Oh no, you can call me Shinji.
The Fifth Child has just arrived.
Kaoru Nagisa, Kaoru of the\NSeashore.  And all of his records\Nhave been erased, just like Rei.
But one record remains.\NHe was born on the day\NSecond Impact occurred.
The committee sent him directly to\Nus.  There must be something else.
The Marduk Report’s file on the\NFifth Child was classified...
...so I hacked into the Intelligence\NDepartment’s computer system.
I can’t believe you did that!
It was worth doing.
I found out where Ritsuko is.
What do you want to do about the\NFifth Child’s synch tests?
I don’t have any tricks up my sleeve\Nthis time.  Let’s see what he can do.
Down another 0.3.
Yes, sir.
Are these data readouts correct?
All testing systems are\Noperating correctly, sir.
The MAGI confirm that there\Nare no data errors.
It’s incredible that he can synch\Nwith Unit 02 before we’ve even\Nconfigured the core.  He’s amazing.
But this isn’t possible!
On this system it can’t happen.
Nevertheless, it is happening.
We must accept that fact and start\Nan investigation into why\Nit’s happening.
You’re the First Child, aren’t you?
Rei Ayanami.
You’re the same as I am.
Who are you?
The Fifth Child has made\Ncontact with Rei.
I see.
The MAGI are currently analyzing the\Nnature of the Fifth and what\Nhis powers may be.
Shinji hasn’t come back yet either.
I’m not deserving of his trust.
Central Dogma is now open.\NPlease use Route 3 to transfer.
Hi, you weren’t waiting here\Nfor me, were you?
No, well, not really waiting anyway.
So what are you doing?
Well, usually when the tests are\Nover, I’ll just take a shower\Nand go home.
But I don’t really want to\Ngo home these days.
The fact that you have a place where\Nyou can return, a home, will lead\Nyou to happiness.  That’s good.
You think so?
I’d like to talk some more.\NMay I come with you?
To the shower.\NAren’t you going now?
Or do you mind?
Oh, no, I don’t mind.
You are extremely afraid\Nof first contact.
Are you that scared of affection?
If you don’t get close to others,\Nyou won’t be betrayed and\Nyou won’t hurt each other.
However, neither will you\Nforget what loneliness is.
Man can never make loneliness\Ndisappear because man is alone,\Nbut man can forget.
So, man can find the will to live.
It’s time.
Is this it?
I have to go to bed.
With me?
No, you have your own\Nroom, I think.
Right...
Man always has pain in his heart.
Since his heart feels pain,\Nhe experiences life as pain.
You are delicate like glass.
Am I?
Yes, and that earns my sympathy.
Sympathy?
In other words, I like you.
NERV was formed as SEELE’s\Nexecutive branch.
It was created to carry\Nout our scenario.
However, it has been taken\Nover by a selfish man.
Yes, it has.  We must return\Nit to our control.
Before the promised day.
We must restore NERV and the Eva\Nseries to their original purpose.
Ikari will answer to SEELE\Nfor his malfeasance.
It will not be much longer.
The Lance of Longinus that was\Nhindering our wish is gone forever.
The last Angel should appear soon\Nand our wish will be attained upon\Ndestroying that Angel.
Soon, very soon, Yui.
I am glad this apartment is in the\Nsuburbs.  Thank God you were safe.
But there is no guarantee\Nthis won’t happen again.
So, the Horaki family will take care\Nof you starting tomorrow.
I won’t be able to see you\Nfor a while, Pen Pen.
I think I should sleep on the floor.
No, I am staying at your place.\NI should sleep down here.
What do you want to talk about?
You want me to listen to\Nyou, don’t you?
Many things have happened since\NI came here.
I used to live with my teacher.\NThey were calm and boring days.
I was just living...
But I was fine with that!
There was really nothing I had to do.
Do you hate people?
Not really, I don’t care.
But I hate my dad.
I was probably born to meet you.
Did you get his data?
This is it.  I got this from Ibuki\Nwithout her knowledge.
I’m sorry that I made you do this.
What is this?
No wonder Maya can’t reveal this.\NThis is not theoretically possible!
You’re right.  The issue gets\Neven more mysterious.
How can he fix the synch ratio at\Nwhatever point he wishes?
I have to take another chance.
What a surprise to see you here.
I have a question for you.
Our conversation is monitored here.
I don’t care.
What is the boy, the Fifth Child?
He is probably the last Angel.
Well, let’s go.  Come, Adam’s alter\Nego and Lilith’s minion.
Eva Unit 02 is activating!
That’s impossible!  Where’s Asuka?
She’s in room 303!\NI’ve just confirmed it!
Then who the hell is piloting it?!
It is unmanned!  There is no entry\Nplug inserted in Unit 02!
AT Field detected in\NCentral Dogma!
Is it Unit 02?
No, the blood pattern is blue!\NIt’s definitely an Angel!
What the hell?!
That boy?  An Angel?
Target has passed the Fourth Layer\Nand is still descending.
It’s no good!  We can’t cut the\Npower to the linear carriage!
Target has passed the Fifth Layer.
Close all Central Dogma shutters!\NBuy us some time!
Closing all shutters immediately.\NAll personnel evacuate.\NAll personnel evacuate.
Unbelievable, SEELE itself\Nsent an Angel to us.
The old men want to advance\Nanother step with our help.
The last Angel has invaded Central\NDogma.  It is currently descending.
Just as we planned.
Ikari, you were our good friend,\Nour comrade and conspirator,\Nbut this is your last job.
I expect that you will use Unit 01\Nto accomplish the mission.
Unit 02 has penetrated\Nthe armored shutters!
Target has passed the second wall.
Pursue it with Unit 01.
Yes, sir!
Use any means to keep it from\Ninvading Terminal Dogma.
Is it going to fuse with Unit 02?
Or is it going to bring destruction?
Lie!  Lie!  It’s a lie!!  I don’t believe\Nthat Kaoru is an Angel!  It’s a lie!
This is a fact, face it.  Sortie.
You got it?
Shinji is late.
Eva Unit 01 is descending via\NRoute 2.  Pursuing the target.
You betrayed me!\NYou hurt my feelings!
You betrayed me just like\Nmy father did!!
Unit 01 has reached the Fourth\NLayer.  It’s about to confront\Nthe target!
There he is!
I have been waiting for you, Shinji.
Kaoru!
I’m sorry, Asuka!
The Eva series were born from\NAdam.  The entire human race\Nmust abhor their existence.
Lilim try to survive even if it\Nmeans taking advantage of\Nthe thing they hate.
I do not understand this.
Kaoru, stop this!\NWhy are you doing this?!
Eva is created from the\Nsame tissue as I am.
I am also born from Adam.
So I can synchronize with it as\Neasily as if it had no soul.
Unit 02’s soul is now\Nshutting itself up.
An AT Field?!
Yes, that’s what you\NLilim call this.
This is the light of the soul,\Nsacred territory where no\None should intrude.
Don’t you Lilim know?
Everybody has an AT Field.
I don’t understand what\Nyou’re talking about!
Both Evas have reached\Nthe deepest layer.
Target is 20 meters away from\NTerminal Dogma.
If Unit 01’s signal disappears and\Nthen any change occurs...
I know; self-destruct\Nthe entire complex.
It’s better than letting the\NThird Impact occur.
I’m sorry.
I don’t mind it if it’s with you.
Thank you.
What is this?!
The strongest AT Field ever\Nhas been detected!
It’s shutting out everything!  Light,\Nmagnetism, sub-atomic particles!\NWe can’t monitor anything!!
This is absolutely impossible!
Signals from the target, Unit 02\Nand Unit 01 are lost!  We’ve lost\Ncommunication with the pilot!
Kaoru!
Wait!!
Final safety system released!
Heaven’s Door is opening!
The Angel has finally reached it.
Hyuga...
What is this?
What’s going on?!
Another AT Field!
A field as strong as the first one has\Nappeared around Terminal Dogma!
It’s invading the other AT Field!
Impossible!  Is it another Angel?!
I don’t know!  I can’t confirm it!
God!  It just disappeared!
Disappeared?  The Angel has?
Adam...
...our mother.  One who is born from\NAdam must return to Adam.
Although it could destroy\Nall humanity?
No!  This is...  Lilith?
I see.  I understand Lilim.
Thank you, Shinji.
I wanted you to stop Unit 02.
Otherwise I would survive with her.
Kaoru, why?
Because it is my destiny to live\Nalthough it would bring\Ndestruction to humanity.
I would prefer to die here.  Life\Nand death are equal to me.
Death of the self, that is the\Nonly absolute freedom.
What are you?
I don’t understand what\Nyou’re talking about!
That is my will.
Now, destroy me.
Otherwise you will be destroyed.
Only one life form can be chosen to\Nevade the destruction and\Ninherit the future.
And you are not the existence\Nthat should die.
You need the future.
Thank you, my life was meaningful\Nbecause of you.
Kaoru said he liked me.
I have never...  never had\Nsuch kind words.
He was like me, and like Ayanami.
I liked him, too.
Kaoru should have survived.\NHe was much better than I am.
Kaoru should have survived.
No, the one who survives is the one\Nwho has the will to survive.
He wished for death.  He neglected\Nhis will to survive and chose\Na false hope.
You are not wrong.
How can you be so cruel?
The last Angel is gone,\Nbut Shinji is anguished.
Misato and Asuka, too, reveal their\Nmind and they ask people for hope...
...while accepting facts as\Na kind of end.
Next episode: “The Ending World.”
Like an angel that has no\Nsense of mercy...
Rise, young boy, to the heavens\Nlike a legend.
Cold winds, as blue as the sea,
Tear open the door to\Nyour heart, I see.
But unknowing you seem, just\Nstaring at me...
Standing there smiling serenely.
Desperate, for something to touch...
A moment of kindness like\Nthat in a dream.
Your innocent eyes, have yet no idea...
Of the path your destiny will follow.
But someday you’ll become aware of...
Everything that you’ve got behind you.
Your wings are for seeking out a new...
Future that only you can search for.
The cruel angel’s thesis enters through\Nthe window of your soul.
If you should betray the chapel\Nof your memories.
The cruel angel’s thesis bleeds through\Na portal like your pulsing blood.
So, boy, stand tall and embrace\Nthe fire of the legend,
Embracing the universe like\Na blazing star!
There was no other choice!
Because he was an Angel!\NKaoru was an Angel!
He was still an Angel!\NHe was still one of the enemy!
He wasn’t!  He wasn’t!  He was not!!
Even though he was\Nas human as me?
No!  He was an Angel!!
Is that why you killed him?
Yes!  Otherwise we all would have died!\NWe would all have been destroyed!
So that’s why you killed him?
I didn’t want to kill him!\NI didn’t have a choice!!
Help me...
Help me.
Help me!
Somebody, please, help me!
I’m begging you!\NSomebody, please, help me!!
You know, it was Kaoru who\Nshould have survived.
He was much better than I am.
He was the one who should\Nhave survived.
No, the one who survives is the one\Nwho has the will to survive.
He wished for death.\NHe neglected his will to survive\Nand chose a false hope.
You weren’t wrong, Shinji.
Are you sure?
Are you sure it was right?
I don’t understand.
What can I do?
What am I supposed to do?!
What was that?
I fear myself.
I fear being hated.
But by whom?
Who is it?
It’s my...
...father!
My father abandoned me.\NHe hates me.
If others hate me, what will I do?\NWhat will I do?
Where am I?
Where am I supposed to go?
I can’t see anything.  I don’t\Nunderstand what I feel.
Misato?
Misato?!
Hey, where are you, Misato?
Hey, where am I supposed to go?
Misato?  Asuka?  Ayanami?
Toji?  Kensuke?  Ritsuko?  Kaji?
Father?
Mother?
Somebody, please!  Please tell\Nme what I have to do now!
Evangelion Unit 01...
I still have to pilot it?\NEven after it made me kill him?
My father and the others tell me that\NI have to pilot it no matter what.
Why do I have to keep fighting\Nafter all that’s happened?!
Mother!
Say something!  Answer me!!
Because everyone tells me to.
What do you mean?  It’s for the sake\Nof mankind!  Isn’t that good enough?
That’s right!  Is there something\Nwrong with that?!  I’m doing\Nthe right thing!
When I do it the others appreciate\Nme!  The others like me then!
You’re lying!
Are you stupid?!
You know damn well that\Nyou do this for yourself!
You’re just making excuses,\Nthe way you always do!
I do?
Pretending that you’re sacrificing\Nyourself for the sake of others is\Njust another cop-out, isn’t it?
It makes you feel so superior\Nto play the martyr!
I’m not sure that’s true.
You’re feeling lonely and\Nisolated, nothing more.
Am I?
Of course you are!  You live on\Nsympathy!  You gain it through your\Nsymbiosis with your Eva, Shinji!
It could be true.
You love having others depend on\Nyou!  It really satisfies your\Ntwisted little mind!
That could be.
All you’re doing is sitting there\Nand waiting for someone else\Nto bring you happiness!
But it’s a false happiness!
But isn’t that what you’ve\Nbeen doing?
I didn’t want to be in this Eva again.\NThey’re forcing me to pilot this.
But this piece of junk won’t work!
But it’s only junk because of what\NI’ve become.  I’m the garbage now.
I’m worthless.  Nobody needs me.
Nobody needs a pilot who can’t\Neven control her own Eva.
You seek your own value in\Nthe perception of others.
Shut up!
Do you fear being alone?
Are you afraid that you will lose\Nyour identity if others leave you?
You pilot the Eva so that you’ll\Nbe praised by others.
Shut up!  Shut up!  Just shut up!
How can a wind-up doll like\Nyou dare to tell me that?!
Who am I?
You are Rei Ayanami.
But who are you?
Are you Rei Ayanami as well?
Correct, I am that which is\Nrecognized as Rei Ayanami.
We are all things that are known\Nas Rei Ayanami.
How could all of these be me?
It is simply because the others call\Nus Rei Ayanami, that is all.
You possess a false soul and a fake\Nbody?  Do you know why?
I am neither false nor fake.\NI am simply me.
No, you are an empty shell with\Na false soul, created by a man\Nnamed Gendo Ikari.
You are just an object that is\Npretending to be a human.
See, look deep within yourself.
Do you perceive the almost\Nintangible, invisible presence that\Nlurks inside your darkest dreams?
It is there that your true identity lies.
No, I am me.
I became myself through the\Ninstrumentality of the links and\Nmy relationships with others.
I am formed by interaction\Nwith others.  They create\Nme as I create them.
These relationships and interactions\Nserve to shape the patterns\Nof my heart and mind.
Yes, that is the name for what I share\Nwith those who have created the\Nbeing known as Rei Ayanami.
That is what will continue\Nto shape me.
However, there is someone else\Nwho is your true self.
You don’t know her, but she exists.
You deny that fact and attempt to\Nsuppress that facet of your reality.
Because she might not\Nhave a human form.
Because then your present\Nself might cease to be.
This is what you fear,\Nthat you will become nothing.
You are frightened that you will\Ndisappear from the minds of\Nothers if another exists.
I’m afraid?  Why is that?
Because then your current self\Nwill have never existed.
Because you will cease to be.
No, I’m happy.
Because I want to die.  I want\Ndespair.  I want to return to nothing.
But I can’t.
He won’t let me return to nothingness\Nyet.  He won’t let me return yet.
I still exist because he needs me.
But when everything is over...
...when I am of no use anymore...
...he will abandon me.
I’ve prayed for the day he\Nwould abandon me.
But now...  I fear it.
Well, let’s go.  This is the day for\Nwhich you were created, Rei.
Yes, sir.
What is this feeling?
I think I’ve experienced this\Nsensation before.
It’s as though my physical form\Nwere disappearing.
It feels nice.
As though my being is spreading\Nitself out to cover the entirety\Nof existence.
Incorrect.  It is not a return\Nto nothingness.
It is merely a return to the\Nstate of beginning.
It is no less than a return to\Nthe primal womb that we\Nlost so long ago.
All individual souls and minds\Nwill become one, thereby attaining\Na state of eternal peace.
The final goal is nothing\Nmore than that.
And that’s Instrumentality?
Yes, there is an emptiness at the very\Ncore of our souls, a fundamental\Nincompleteness...
...that has haunted all beings since\Nthe very first thought.
On a primal level, man has always\Nbeen aware of the darkness\Nat the core of his mind.
We seek to escape this void\Nand the fear it causes.
All man’s accomplishments proceed\Nfrom hopes of filling it.
Yet, the darkness will never vanish\Nas long as mankind is merely human.
And so you’ll just crush everyone’s\Nminds together to fill the gaps?!
How dare you presume to make the\Nentirety of human existence into an\Nexperiment to prove your theory?!
And to use deception in order\Nto accomplish it?!
And yet, that is exactly as\Nyou wished it to be!
Where am I?
This is the me that exists\Nin your mind, Misato.
And yet, at the same time this is also\Nthe me which exists in your mind,\Nisn’t it, Shinji?
In order to establish my identity,\NI have to communicate with the\Nminds of many people.
I have to examine that\Nwhich is at my core.
I have to stare at Misato who resides\Non the inside of my mind.
What is it that you wish for, Misato?
I have to be a good child.
Because I have no papa.\NBecause I have to be good and\Nnot bother my mama.
But I don’t want to become\Nlike my mama.
When my papa is not here,\Nshe always cries.
I can’t cry.  I can’t depend\Non anyone else.
So, I have to be good.
That way, maybe my papa\Nwon’t hate me.
But I hated my father,\Nand I hated being a good child.
I hate it.
I’m tired of it.
I’m tired of keeping myself clean.
I’m tired of myself pretending\Nto be pure and noble.
I’m so tired of it all.
I want to disgrace myself.
I want to see my life and\Nmy reputation ruined.
Is that why you slept with him?\NWith Kaji?
No!  I slept with him because\NI loved him.
Did you really love him?
Yes, I did!  He accepted\Nme for myself!!
He was kind!
No!  Don’t show this to Shinji!!
Why are you still embarrassed after\Nall that’s happened?
Because I’m ashamed of it!
Why does this embarrass you?
You aren’t ashamed.  Rather,\Nyou take great pleasure in revealing\Nyourself to the one you love.
No, don’t do this!!
You’re happy to show this\Nto Shinji, aren’t you?
It’s a lie!  No, no, I’m not!!
Are you sure?  Or perhaps it’s your\Nfather that you’d like to show this to?
No!
Wasn’t it really peace of mind that\Nyou were seeking in Kaji’s bed?
No!
You wanted peace of mind and\Nwarmth from Kaji, right?
No!!
You wanted to find your father in\NKaji’s embrace, didn’t you?
It’s not true!
It is true.
In Kaji, I had found\Nmy father reborn.
And so, I fled from him.
I was so afraid.\NHe was so much like my father.
But at the same time, I was also very\Nhappy.  I was never happier.
That was such a wonderful time.
That’s why I hated it.\NThat’s why I left.
So, no reason was required to\Nbegin our love, but you needed\Na reason for ending it?
You are so kind, Kaji.
You are so kind.  I beg you...
...disgrace me.
Just because you hate yourself is no\Nreason to injure yourself further.
Punishing yourself is simply\Na cheat to make you feel better\Nfor a little while.
Don’t do this to yourself.
And now, you’ll tell me to\Ntake care of myself?
Men always do that.
They escape to their jobs, their own\Nworld, and leave me behind.
They always leave me behind.
Just like my father did.
They always escape from\Nthe harsh realities.
Harsh reality?  I am his harsh reality.
Of course, I’m a problem, aren’t I?
Stop that, Misato!
I despise myself!  I hate myself!
You’re vulgar and impure.
You’re pathetic.
You’re disgusting!\NYou’re a dirty whore!
I’ve never seen anyone in such\Na disgusting relationship!
Congratulations on your promotion,\NMajor Katsuragi!
The me who is recognized is\Nthe me who’s performing a role\Nin order to be appreciated...
...but she’s not the real me.
Your true self is always\Ncrying, isn’t she?
Yes, but I’m happy.
I am happy.
It’s true, I am happy!
I’m not!  This isn’t the\Nhappiness I want!
This isn’t me, it’s not my true self!
I just don’t want to face\Nthe harsh reality!
But we must.\NWe can’t live otherwise.
You’d be alone and afraid...
...unstable...
...if no one were sleeping next to you.
Are you afraid of sleeping alone?
Or does sleeping by yourself remind\Nyou of how empty your life is?
She can’t stand not having\Nother souls around her.
So, you’ll sleep with\Nanyone, won’t you?
No!!
Yes, you just want to be infatuated\Nwith primal ecstasy.
You want to fill the hole in your\Nheart with temporary escape.
You take advantage of men to soothe\Nthe pain in your soul.
No!  No!  No!!
Where am I?
This is the me which exists\Nin your mind, Asuka.
And yet, at the same time this is also\Nthe me which exists in your mind,\Nisn’t it, Shinji?
What do you want, Asuka?
I want to live by myself!
I don’t want my papa and my\Nmomma.  I’ll live by myself!
And then I won’t cry anymore!
But I’m still crying.
Why am I still crying?
I’m sorry, I just don’t like her.
What happened to you, the capable doctor?
I told you, I’m a human being\Nbefore I’m a doctor.
But how can a trained\Nprofessional like you...
She acts too much like an adult and\Nshe rejects me absolutely.
Sometimes she even scares me.
Have you gotten such a\Nfeeling from her?
No, and, in any case, you are\Nnow Asuka’s mother.
That may be, but I’m your\Nwife before that.
Both duties are concurrent.
In a social perspective, yes.
But you can’t quit being her father.
I can quit being her mother anytime.
Well, you could say so.
No, Momma!  Don’t quit being my\Nmomma!  I’ll be a good kid!
Don’t stop being my momma!
Don’t ignore me!
No, Momma!  Don’t kill me!
Your papa hates your momma.
He doesn’t need me anymore.
No, he didn’t love me to begin with.
He didn’t need me at all.
So, let’s die together because\NPapa doesn’t need us.
Am I a waste?\NAm I not worth anything?
Die with me!
No, I am not your doll!  I’ll think\Nfor myself and live by myself!
Then, my momma was hanging\Nfrom the ceiling.
She looked so happy.
But I hated how she looked.
I don’t want to die.\NI don’t want to disappear.
I hate boys!  I hate my papa\Nand my momma!
I hate everyone!
Nobody cares about me.
Nobody stays with me!
So, I don’t want to\Ndepend on anybody!
But I hate it at the same time.\NIt’s a pain!
I don’t want to be alone!
I don’t want to be alone!
I don’t want to be alone!!
Don’t leave me.
Don’t abandon me.
Don’t kill me.
What is this?
This is the Instrumentality which\Nyour father is beginning.
This is it?
This is part of it.
You can’t tell what the truth is.
You can barely tell if what\Nyou’re feeling is real.
The truth is within you.
And the facts that remain in\Nyour memory are what will\Nbecome your truth.
Truth can be changed\Nfrom time to time.
This is all real.  This is the\Nresult of everything?
This is real, but only one\Nof the many realities.
This is the conclusion you wanted.
Wanted?  Me?
Yes, total destruction.  You wished\Nfor a world in which nobody\Nwould be saved.
No!  I didn’t wish for this!\NThe others didn’t save me.
Nobody can save you.
This is what you wished for.
Destruction, death and a return to\Nnothingness...  you wished for these.
This is that reality.
What is reality?
This is your world.
A world for yourself that exists\Nwithout time, space or others.
A world in which every facet\Nwas determined by you.
This is the world where you just wait\Nfor others to give you something.
This is your world no matter what.
This is the world that is!\NNothing can change that!
No, you made the decision.
This is the world where your mind\Ndecides what will be.
Whether it is the will to survive...
...or a wish for death,\Nit is all up to you.
Are you saying that this darkness,\Nthis insane world, are what I\Nreally wished to create?!
Yes.
You wished for a closed world that\Nwas comfortable for you.
In order to protect your weakness...
...to protect your few pleasures.
This is merely a result of your wish.
In your closed world, in a world\Nwhere only you are allowed to be,\Nothers cannot live with you.
But still you wished to close the\Nworld that surrounds you.
Your wish ejected things you\Ndisliked and created an isolated\Nand lonely world.
This is the world your wishes have\Ncreated, a private haven in the\Nrecesses of your mind.
This is how it ends.  It is one of\Nmany possible endings.
This is an ending you brought upon\Nyourself.  You chose this fate.
An end always comes\Nafter a beginning.
Will our hopes result in\Nultimate destruction?
Is our hope death itself?
It’s the final episode:\N“The Beast That Shouted ‘I’ at the\NHeart of the World.”
